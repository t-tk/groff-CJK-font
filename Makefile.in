# GLIBC2
# `GLIBC21' is yes if the host operating system uses GNU libc 2.1 or newer,

# VERSION is set by automake, based on what is passed to AC_INIT.

# PAGE
# Define `page' to be letter if your PostScript printer uses 8.5x11
# paper (USA) and define it to be A4, if it uses A4 paper (rest of the
# world).

# GHOSTSCRIPT
# The name of the ghostscript program. Normally, gs, on GNU/Linux
# but it might be different on MS-DOS/MS-WIN32 systems.

# ALT_GHOSTSCRIPT_PROGS
# `ALT_GHOSTSCRIPT_PROGS' specifies a list alternative names,
# which can be tried if `GHOSTSCRIPT' cannot be found at run time.

# ALT_AWK_PROGS
# Similarly, `ALT_AWK_PROGS' specifies a list of alternative names,
# which can be tried at run time, to identify the awk program.

# BROKEN_SPOOLER_FLAGS
# Normally the Postscript driver, grops, produces output that conforms
# to version 3.0 of the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.
# Unfortunately some spoolers and previewers can't handle such output.
# The BROKEN_SPOOLER_FLAGS variable tells grops what it should do to
# make its output acceptable to such programs.  This variable controls
# only the default behaviour of grops; the behaviour can be changed at
# runtime by the grops -b option (and so by groff -P-b).
# Use a value of 0 if your spoolers and previewers are able to handle
# conforming PostScript correctly.
# Add 1 if no %%{Begin,End}DocumentSetup comments should be generated;
# this is needed for early versions of TranScript that get confused by
# anything between the %%EndProlog line and the first %%Page: comment.
# Add 2 if lines in included files beginning with %! should be
# stripped out; this is needed for the OpenWindows 2.0 pageview previewer.
# Add 4 if %%Page, %%Trailer and %%EndProlog comments should be
# stripped out of included files; this is needed for spoolers that
# don't understand the %%{Begin,End}Document comments. I suspect this
# includes early versions of TranScript.
# Add 8 if the first line of the PostScript output should be %!PS-Adobe-2.0
# rather than %!PS-Adobe-3.0; this is needed when using Sun's Newsprint
# with a printer that requires page reversal.

# `DEVICE' is the default device.

# OTHERDEVDIRS
# `OTHERDEVDIRS' is either `font/devlj4 font/devlbp' (for ASCII) or

# PSPRINT
# `PSPRINT' is the command to use for printing a PostScript file,
# for example `lpr'.

# DVIPRINT
# `DVIPRINT' is the command to use for printing a TeX dvi file,
# for example `lpr -d'.

# g
# Prefix for names of programs that have Unix counterparts.
# For example, if `g' is `g' then troff will be installed as
# gtroff.  This doesn't affect programs like grops or groff that have
# no Unix counterparts.  Note that the groff versions of eqn and tbl

# Case of out-of-source build: we must create the 'man' directory.

# Non-recursive makefile system. See Automake manual '7.3 An
# Alternative Approach to Subdirectories'. We use a single Makefile.am
# that includes other .am files, rather than using SUBDIRS.  Note that
# relative paths in the following .am files are relative to the top
# source directory.

# Adding defs.h to BUILT_SOURCES will ensure that it will be built on
# make all or make check before all other targets. However, if another
# target is built from a clean build tree, (for example make groff)
# the files in BUILT_SOURCES will not be built first. That is why
# additional dependencies were added in the .am files that list
# objects that use defs (for example in groff.am:
# src/roff/groff/groff.$(OBJEXT): defs.h)

# Force generation of test-groff even though we don't ship it.

#   For example: 1.22.3.real.434-5aafd
#   The version is stored in .version.

# Suffix rule to build .1, .5 and .7 files from .1.man, .5.man and
# .7.man files.  The brackets around the @ are used to prevent the
# substitution of the variable by automake.
#
# The sed script transforms - to \-, ~ to \(ti, and so forth, (with an
# extra layer of backslashes--see below) so that Makefile variables
# containing ASCII characters that do not represent themselves literally
# in *roff (see groff_char(7)) are correctly interpolated into man page
# text.
#
# Note that while the script, combined with this target, will transform
# ` to \(ga, including grave accents in Makefile variables is likely to
# fail when the shell lexes the argument to echo within the old-style
# command substitution `` below.  Testing shows that grave accents
# should work* if POSIX-style command substitution $() is done instead.
# However, $() is less portable.  (Triple-escaping grave accents \\\`
# inside the interpolated Makefile variable will work, but is not
# attempted here.)
#
# Note also that the amount of backslash-escaping in the sed script is
# excessive (and incorrect) for normal purposes, but required here
# because a command substitution is being nested inside yet another
# invocation of sed.
#
# * For this target, no assurances about the good behavior of unusual
#   characters in Makefile variables in other aspects of the groff build
#   are offered.

# The installation of groff compatibility wrappers for vendor-provided
# non-GNU macro sets is controlled by 'compatibility_wrappers' (see the
# commentary surrounding m4/groff.m4's
# GROFF_WITH_COMPATIBILITY_WRAPPERS).  Collision detection variables of
# the form 'tmac_<macro>_prefix' are defined in Makefile.am, to assist
# in the installation of groff-provided macro sets.
#
# When 'compatibility_wrappers' is 'no', one step is performed:
#   - the groff-provided macro set implementations are installed in
#     <prefix>/share/groff/<version>/tmac/ with the original macro set
#     name
#
# When 'compatibility_wrappers' is 'yes', two steps are performed:
#   - the groff-provided macro set implementations are installed in
#     <prefix>/share/groff/<version>/tmac/ with a prefix of
#     $(tmac_prefix) (which is usually 'g', via the appropriate
#     collision detection variable)
#   - the generated compatibility wrappers are installed in
#     <prefix>/lib/groff/site-tmac, with the original macro set name
#
# When 'compatibility_wrappers' is 'manual', two steps are performed:
#   - the groff-provided macro set implementations are installed in
#     <prefix>/share/groff/<version>/tmac/ with the original macro set
#     name
#   - the generated compatibility wrappers are installed in
#     <prefix>/lib/groff/site-tmac, with a name of
#     <macro><wrapper_suffix>, (which is usually '-os', see
#     'wrapper_suffix_default' in Makefile.am)
