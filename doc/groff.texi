@c To assure correct HTML translation, some ugly hacks are necessary.
@c While processing a @def... request, the HTML translator looks at the
@c next line to decide whether to start indentation, and if the line
@c starts with @def... (e.g. @deffnx), indentation is started.  We must
@c therefore ensure that a @def... is seen, during macro expansion.
@c
@c The following macros have to be used:
@c
@c One item:
@c
@c   @Def...
@c
@c Two items:
@c
@c   @Def...List
@c   @Def...ListEnd
@c
@c More than two:
@c
@c   @Def...List
@c   @Def...Item
@c   @Def...Item

@c The definition block must end with

@c
@c The above is valid for texinfo 4.0f and above.

@c By default, only the first item generates an index entry.  To

@node What Is groff?, History, Introduction, Introduction
@section What Is @code{groff}?
@cindex what is @code{groff}?
@cindex @code{groff}---what is it?

@code{groff} belongs to an older generation of document preparation
systems, which operate more like compilers than the more recent
interactive @acronym{WYSIWYG}@footnote{What You See Is What You Get}
systems.  @code{groff} and its contemporary counterpart, @TeX{}, both
work using a @dfn{batch} paradigm: The input (or @dfn{source}) files are
normal text files with embedded formatting commands.  These files can
then be processed by @code{groff} to produce a typeset document on a
variety of devices.

@code{groff} should not be confused with a @dfn{word processor}, an
integrated system of editor and text formatter.  Also, many word
processors follow the @acronym{WYSIWYG} paradigm discussed earlier.

Although @acronym{WYSIWYG} systems may be easier to use, they have a
number of disadvantages compared to @code{troff}:

@itemize @bullet
@item
They must be used on a graphics display to work on a document.

@item
Most of the @acronym{WYSIWYG} systems are either non-free or are not
very portable.

@item
@code{troff} is firmly entrenched in all Unix systems.

@item
It is difficult to have a wide range of capabilities within the confines
of a GUI/window system.

@item
It is more difficult to make global changes to a document.

@node History, @code{groff} Capabilities, What Is groff?, Introduction
@section History
@cindex history

@cindex @code{RUNOFF}, the program
@cindex @code{rf}, the program
@code{troff} can trace its origins back to a formatting program called
@code{RUNOFF}, written by Jerry Saltzer, which ran on the @acronym{CTSS}
(@emph{Compatible Time Sharing System}, a project of MIT, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in the
mid-sixties.@footnote{Jerome H.@: Saltzer, a grad student then, later a
Professor of Electrical Engineering, now retired.  Saltzer's PhD thesis
was the first application for @code{RUNOFF} and is available from the
MIT Libraries.}  The name came from the use of the phrase ``run off a
document'', meaning to print it out.
@c
@c Tom Van Vleck <thvv@multicians.org> writes about the following:
@c
@c I am not sure about this.. I think the BCPL runoff was the port to
@c the 635 architecture, and that the order of events is
@c 1. CTSS runoff
@c 2. BCPL runoff on Multics
@c 3. BCPL runoff on 635
@c 4. rf on PDP-7
@c
Bob Morris ported it to the 635 architecture and called the program
@code{roff} (an abbreviation of @code{runoff}).  It was rewritten as
@code{rf} for the @w{PDP-7} (before having Unix), and at the
same time (1969), Doug McIlroy rewrote an extended and simplified
version of @code{roff} in the @acronym{BCPL} programming language.

@cindex @code{roff}, the program
In 1971, the Unix developers wanted to get a @w{PDP-11}, and to justify
the cost, proposed the development of a document formatting system for
the @acronym{AT&T} patents division.  This first formatting program was
a reimplementation of McIlroy's @code{roff}, written by J.@tie{}F.@:
Ossanna.

@cindex @code{nroff}, the program
When they needed a more flexible language, a new version of @code{roff}
called @code{nroff} (after ``new @code{roff}'', pronounced
@w{``en-roff''}) was written.  It had a much more complicated syntax,
but provided the basis for all future versions.  When they got a Graphic
Systems CAT Phototypesetter, Ossanna wrote a version of @code{nroff}
that would drive it.  It was dubbed @code{troff}, for ``typesetter
@code{roff}'', although many people have speculated that it actually
means ``Times @code{roff}'' because of the use of the Times font family
in @code{troff} by default.  As such, the name @code{troff} is
pronounced ``@w{tee-roff}'' rather than ``trough''.

With @code{troff} came @code{nroff} (by 1974, they were actually the
same program except for some @samp{#ifdef}s), which was for producing
output for line printers and character terminals.  It understood
everything @code{troff} did, and ignored the commands that were not
applicable (e.g., font changes).

Since there are several things that cannot be done easily in
@code{troff}, work on several preprocessors began.  These programs would
transform certain parts of a document into @code{troff}, which made a
very natural use of pipes in Unix.

The @code{eqn} preprocessor allowed mathematical formulae to be
specified in a much simpler and more intuitive manner.  @code{tbl} is a
preprocessor for formatting tables.  The @code{refer} preprocessor (and
the similar program, @code{bib}) processes citations in a document
according to a bibliographic database.

Unfortunately, Ossanna's @code{troff} was written in @w{PDP-11} assembly
language and produced output specifically for the CAT phototypesetter.
He rewrote it in C, although it was now 7000@tie{}lines of uncommented
code and still dependent on the CAT@.  As the CAT became less common,
and was no longer supported by the manufacturer, the need to make it
support other devices became a priority.  However, before this could be
done, Ossanna died from a severe heart attack in a hospital while
recovering from a previous one.

@pindex ditroff
@cindex @code{ditroff}, the program
Brian Kernighan took on the task of rewriting @code{troff}.  The result
produced device-independent code that was easy for postprocessors to
read and translate to appropriate printer commands.  This new
``device-independent @code{troff}'', called @code{ditroff} by some, had
several extensions, including drawing commands for lines, circles,
ellipses, arcs, and B-splines.@footnote{Short for ``basis splines''; ask
your local numerical analyst.  The rest of us can just think of them as
``curves''.}

Due to the additional abilities of the new version of @code{troff},
several new preprocessors appeared.  The @code{pic} preprocessor
provides a wide range of drawing functions.  Likewise the @code{ideal}
preprocessor did the same, although via a much different paradigm.  The
@code{grap} preprocessor took specifications for graphs, but, unlike
other preprocessors, produced @code{pic} code.

James Clark began work on a GNU implementation of device-independent
@code{troff} in early@tie{}1989.  The first version,
@code{groff}@tie{}0.3.1, was released June@tie{}1990.  @code{groff}
included:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A replacement for @acronym{AT&T} device-independent @code{troff} with
many extensions.

@item
The @code{soelim}, @code{pic}, @code{tbl}, and @code{eqn} preprocessors.

@item
@cindex X Window System (X11)
@cindex @TeX{} Device-Independent (DVI) format
Postprocessors for character devices, PostScript, @TeX{}'s
device-independent format (DVI), and the X@tie{}Window System (X11).
GNU @code{troff} also eliminated the need for a separate @command{nroff}
program with a postprocessor to produce output for @acronym{ASCII}
terminals.

@item
A version of the @file{me} macros and an implementation of the
@file{man} macros.
@end itemize

Also, a front end was included that could construct the---sometimes
painfully long---pipelines required for all the pre- and postprocessors.

Development of GNU @code{troff} progressed rapidly, and saw the
additions of a replacement for @code{refer}, an implementation of the
@file{ms} and @file{mm} macros, and a program to deduce how to format a
document (@code{grog}).

It was declared a stable (i.e., non-beta) package with the release of
version@tie{}1.04 around November@tie{}1991.

Beginning in@tie{}1999, @code{groff} has new maintainers (the package
was an orphan for a few years).  As a result, new features and programs
like @code{grn}, a preprocessor for gremlin images, and an output device
to produce @acronym{HTML} and @acronym{XHTML} have been added.

@section Macro Packages
@cindex macro package, introduction
@cindex package, macro, introduction

Since @code{groff} provides such low-level facilities, it can be quite
difficult to use by itself.  However, @code{groff} provides a
@dfn{macro} facility to specify how certain routine operations, such as
starting paragraphs, or printing headers and footers, should be done.
These macros can be collected together into a @dfn{macro package}.
There are a number of macro packages available; the most common (and the
ones described in this manual) are @file{man}, @file{mdoc}, @file{me},
@file{ms}, and @file{mm}.


@c =====================================================================

@node Preprocessor Intro, Output Device Intro, Macro Package Intro, Introduction
@section Preprocessors
@cindex preprocessors

Although @code{groff} provides most functions needed to format a
document, some operations would be unwieldy (e.g., to draw pictures).
Therefore, programs called @dfn{preprocessors} were written that
understand their own language and produce the necessary @code{groff}
operations.  These preprocessors are able to differentiate their own
input from the rest of the document via markers.

To use a preprocessor, Unix pipes are used to feed the output from the
preprocessor into @code{groff}.  Any number of preprocessors may be used
on a given document; in this case, the preprocessors are linked together
into one pipeline.  However, with @code{groff}, the user does not need
to construct the pipe, but only tell @code{groff} what preprocessors to
use.

@code{groff} currently has preprocessors for producing tables
(@code{tbl}), typesetting equations (@code{eqn}), drawing pictures
(@code{pic} and @code{grn}), processing bibliographies
(@code{refer}), and drawing chemical structures (@code{chem}).  An
associated program that is useful when dealing with preprocessors is
@code{soelim}.

A free implementation of @code{grap}, a preprocessor for drawing graphs,
can be obtained as an extra package; @code{groff} can use @code{grap}
also.

Unique to @code{groff} is the @code{preconv} preprocessor that enables
@code{groff} to handle documents in various input encodings.

Other preprocessors exist, but, unfortunately, no free implementations
are available.  Among them is a preprocessor for drawing mathematical
pictures (@code{ideal}).

@cindex devices for output

@code{groff} produces device-independent code that may be fed into a
postprocessor to produce output for a particular device.  Currently,
@code{groff} has postprocessors for PostScript devices, character
terminals, X11 (for previewing), DVI, HP LaserJet@tie{}4 and Canon LBP
printers (which use @acronym{CaPSL}), @acronym{HTML}, @acronym{XHTML},
and @acronym{PDF}.

@node Conventions Used in This Manual, Credits, Output Device Intro, Introduction
@section Conventions Used in This Manual

We use Texinfo's ``result'' (@result{}) and @error{} notations to
present output written to the standard output and standard error
streams, respectively.  Diagnostic messages from the GNU @code{troff}
formatter and other programs are examples of the latter, but the
formatter can also be directed to write user-specified messages to the
standard error stream.  The notation then serves to distinguish the
output stream and does not necessarily mean that an error has
occurred.@footnote{Unix and related operating systems distinguish
standard output and standard error streams @emph{because} of
@code{troff}:@:
@uref{https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2013-December/006113.html}.}

@Example
$ echo "Twelve o'clock and" | groff -Tascii | sed '/^$/d'
    @result{} Twelve o'clock and
$ echo '.tm all is well.' | groff > /dev/null
    @error{} all is well.
@endExample

We also present diagnostic messages in an abbreviated form, often
omitting the name of the program issuing them, the input file name, and
line number or other positional information when such data do not serve
to illuminate the topic under discussion.

You are encouraged to try the examples yourself, and to alter them to
better learn @code{groff}'s behavior.  Our examples frequently need to
direct the formatter to set a line length (with @samp{.ll}) that will
fit within the page margins of this manual.  We mention this so that you
know why it is there before we discuss the @code{ll} request
formally.@footnote{@xref{Line Layout}.}

@cindex @code{groff} invocation

This section focuses on how to invoke the @code{groff} front end.  This
front end takes care of the details of constructing the pipeline among
the preprocessors, @code{gtroff} and the postprocessor.

It has become a tradition that GNU programs get the prefix @samp{g} to
distinguish them from their original counterparts provided by the host
(@pxref{Environment}).  Thus, for example, @code{geqn} is GNU
@code{eqn}.  On operating systems like GNU/Linux or the Hurd, which
don't contain proprietary versions of @code{troff}, and on
MS-DOS/MS-Windows, where @code{troff} and associated programs are not
available at all, this prefix is omitted since GNU @code{troff} is the
only incarnation of @code{troff} used.  Exception: @samp{groff} is never
replaced by @samp{roff}.

In this document, we consequently say @samp{gtroff} when talking about
the GNU @code{troff} program.  @c XXX: Not for much longer... -- GBR
All other implementations of @code{troff} are called @acronym{AT&T}
@code{troff}, which is the common origin of almost all @code{troff}
implementations@footnote{Besides @code{groff}, @code{neatroff} is an
exception.} (with more or less compatible changes).  Similarly, we say
@samp{gpic}, @samp{geqn}, and so on.

@code{groff} normally runs the @code{gtroff} program and a
postprocessor appropriate for the selected device.  The default device
is @samp{ps} (but it can be changed when @code{groff} is configured and
built).  It can optionally preprocess with any of @code{gpic},
@code{geqn}, @code{gtbl}, @code{ggrn}, @code{grap}, @code{gchem},
@code{grefer}, @code{gsoelim}, or @code{preconv}.

This section only documents options to the @code{groff} front end.  Many
of the arguments to @code{groff} are passed on to @code{gtroff},
therefore those are also included.  Arguments to pre- or postprocessors
can be found in @ref{Invoking gpic}, @ref{Invoking geqn}, @ref{Invoking
gtbl}, @ref{Invoking ggrn}, @ref{Invoking grefer}, @ref{Invoking gchem},
@ref{Invoking gsoelim}, @ref{Invoking preconv}, @ref{Invoking grotty},
@ref{Invoking grops}, @ref{Invoking gropdf}, @ref{Invoking grohtml},
@ref{Invoking grodvi}, @ref{Invoking grolj4}, @ref{Invoking grolbp}, and
@ref{Invoking gxditview}.

The command-line format for @code{groff} is:

@Example
groff [ -abceghijklpstvzCEGNRSUVXZ ] [ -d@var{cs} ] [ -D@var{arg} ]
      [ -f@var{fam} ] [ -F@var{dir} ] [ -I@var{dir} ] [ -K@var{arg} ]
      [ -L@var{arg} ] [ -m@var{name} ] [ -M@var{dir} ] [ -n@var{num} ]
      [ -o@var{list} ] [ -P@var{arg} ] [ -r@var{cn} ] [ -T@var{dev} ]
      [ -w@var{name} ] [ -W@var{name} ] [ @var{files}@dots{} ]
@endExample

The command-line format for @code{gtroff} is as follows.

@Example
gtroff [ -abcivzCERU ] [ -d@var{cs} ] [ -f@var{fam} ] [ -F@var{dir} ]
       [ -m@var{name} ] [ -M@var{dir} ] [ -n@var{num} ] [ -o@var{list} ]
       [ -r@var{cn} ] [ -T@var{name} ] [ -w@var{name} ] [ -W@var{name} ]
       [ @var{files}@dots{} ]
@endExample

@noindent
Obviously, many of the options to @code{groff} are actually passed on to
@code{gtroff}.

Options without an argument can be grouped behind a
single@tie{}@option{-}.  A filename of@tie{}@file{-} denotes the
standard input.  Whitespace is permitted between an option and its
argument.

The @code{grog} command can be used to guess the correct @code{groff}
command to format a file.

Here's the description of the command-line options:

@cindex command-line options
@table @samp
@item -a
@cindex plain text approximation output register (@code{.A})
Generate a plain text approximation of the typeset output.  The
read-only register @code{.A} is set to@tie{}1.  @xref{Built-in
Registers}.  This option produces a sort of abstract preview of the
formatted output.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Page breaks are marked by a phrase in angle brackets; for example,
@samp{<beginning of page>}.

@item
Lines are broken where they would be in the formatted output.

@item
A horizontal motion of any size is represented as one space.  Adjacent
horizontal motions are not combined.  Inter-sentence space nodes (those
arising from the second argument to the @code{ss} request) are not
represented.

@item
Vertical motions are not represented.

@item
Special characters are rendered in angle brackets; for example, the
default soft hyphen character appears as @samp{<hy>}.
@end itemize

The above description should not be considered a specification; the
details of @option{-a} output are subject to change.

@item -b
Print a backtrace with each warning or error message.  This backtrace
should help track down the cause of the error.  The line numbers given
in the backtrace may not always be correct: @code{gtroff} can get
confused by @code{as} or @code{am} requests while counting line numbers.

@item -c
Suppress color output.

@item -C
Enable compatibility mode.  @xref{Implementation Differences}, for the
list of incompatibilities between @code{groff} and @acronym{AT&T}
@code{troff}.

@item -d@var{c}@var{s}
@itemx -d@var{name}=@var{s}
Define @var{c} or @var{name} to be a string@tie{}@var{s}.
@var{c}@tie{}must be a one-letter name; @var{name} can be of arbitrary
length.  All string assignments happen before loading any macro file
(including the startup file).

@item -D@var{arg}
Set default input encoding used by @code{preconv} to @var{arg}.  Implies
@option{-k}.

@item -e
Preprocess with @code{geqn}.

@item -E
Inhibit all error messages.

@item -f@var{fam}
Use @var{fam} as the default font family.  @xref{Font Families}.

@item -F@var{dir}
Search @file{@var{dir}} for subdirectories @file{dev@var{name}}
(@var{name} is the name of the device), for the @file{DESC} file, and
for font files before looking in the standard directories (@pxref{Font
Directories}).  This option is passed to all pre- and postprocessors
using the @env{GROFF_FONT_PATH} environment variable.

@item -g
Preprocess with @code{ggrn}.

@item -G
Preprocess with @code{grap}.  Implies @option{-p}.

@item -h
Print a help message.

@item -i
Read the standard input after all the named input files have been
processed.

@item -I@var{dir}
Search @var{dir} for files named in several contexts; implies
@option{-g} and @option{-s}.  Files are sought for several purposes.

@itemize
@item
@code{gsoelim} replaces @code{so} requests with the contents of their
file name arguments (@pxref{gsoelim} for more details).

@item
@code{gtroff} searches for files named as operands in its command line
and as arguments to @code{psbb}, @code{so}, and @code{soquiet} requests.

@item
Output drivers may search for files; for instance, @code{grops} looks
for files named in @samp{\X'ps: import @r{@dots{}}'}, @samp{\X'ps: file
@r{@dots{}}'}, and @samp{\X'pdf: pdfpic @r{@dots{}}'} device control
escape sequences.
@end itemize

This option may be specified more than once; the directories are
searched in the order specified.  If you want to search the current
directory before others, add @samp{-I .} at the desired place.  The
current working directory is otherwise searched last.  @option{-I} works
similarly to, and is named for, the ``include'' option of Unix C
compilers.

@option{-I} options are passed to @code{gsoelim}, @code{gtroff}, and
output drivers; with the flag letter changed to @option{-M}, they are
also passed to @code{ggrn}.

@item -j
Preprocess with @code{gchem}.  Implies @option{-p}.

@item -k
Preprocess with @code{preconv}.  This is run before any other
preprocessor.  Please refer to @code{preconv}'s man page for its
behaviour if no @option{-K} (or @option{-D}) option is specified.

@item -K@var{arg}
Set input encoding used by preconv to @var{arg}.  Implies @option{-k}.

@item -l
Send the output to a spooler for printing.  The command used for this is
specified by the @code{print} command in the device description file
(@pxref{Device and Font Description Files}).  If not present,
@option{-l} is ignored.

@item -L@var{arg}
Pass @var{arg} to the spooler.  Each argument should be passed with a
separate @option{-L} option.  @code{groff} does not prepend a @samp{-}
to @var{arg} before passing it to the postprocessor.  If the
@code{print} keyword in the device description file is missing,
@option{-L} is ignored.

@item -m@var{name}
Read in the file @file{@var{name}.tmac}.  Normally @code{groff} searches
for this in its macro directories.  If it isn't found, it tries
@file{tmac.@var{name}} (searching in the same directories).

@item -M@var{dir}
Search directory @file{@var{dir}} for macro files before the standard
directories (@pxref{Macro Directories}).

@item -n@var{num}
Number the first page @var{num}.

@item -N
Don't allow newlines with @code{eqn} delimiters.  This is the same as
the @option{-N} option in @code{geqn}.

@item -o@var{list}
@cindex print current page register (@code{.P})
Output only pages in @var{list}, which is a comma-separated list of page
ranges; @samp{@var{n}} means print page@tie{}@var{n},
@samp{@var{m}-@var{n}} means print every page between @var{m}
and@tie{}@var{n}, @samp{-@var{n}} means print every page up
to@tie{}@var{n}, @samp{@var{n}-} means print every page beginning
with@tie{}@var{n}.  @code{gtroff} exits after printing the last page in
the list.  All the ranges are inclusive on both ends.

Within @code{gtroff}, this information can be extracted with the
@samp{.P} register.  @xref{Built-in Registers}.

If your document restarts page numbering at the beginning of each
chapter, then @code{gtroff} prints the specified page range for each
chapter.

@item -p
Preprocess with @code{gpic}.

@item -P@var{arg}
Pass @var{arg} to the postprocessor.  Each argument should be passed
with a separate @option{-P} option.  Note that @code{groff} does not
prepend @samp{-} to @var{arg} before passing it to the postprocessor.

@item -r@var{c}@var{n}
@itemx -r@var{name}=@var{n}
Set register@tie{}@var{c} or @var{name} to the value@tie{}@var{n}.
@var{c}@tie{}must be a one-letter name; @var{name} can be of arbitrary
length.  @var{n}@tie{}can be any @code{gtroff} numeric expression.  All
register assignments happen before loading any macro file (including the
startup file).

@item -R
Preprocess with @code{grefer}.  No mechanism is provided for passing
arguments to @code{grefer} because most @code{grefer} options have
equivalent commands that can be included in the file.  @xref{grefer},
for more details.

@pindex troffrc
@pindex troffrc-end
@code{gtroff} also accepts a @option{-R} option, which is not
accessible via @code{groff}.  This option prevents the loading of the
@file{troffrc} and @file{troffrc-end} files.

@item -s
Preprocess with @code{gsoelim}.

@item -S
@cindex @code{open} request, and safer mode
@cindex @code{opena} request, and safer mode
@cindex @code{pso} request, and safer mode
@cindex @code{sy} request, and safer mode
@cindex @code{pi} request, and safer mode
@cindex safer mode
@cindex mode, safer
Safer mode.  Pass the @option{-S} option to @code{gpic} and disable the
@code{open}, @code{opena}, @code{pso}, @code{sy}, and @code{pi}
requests.  For security reasons, this is enabled by default.

@item -t
Preprocess with @code{gtbl}.

@item -T@var{dev}
Prepare output for device @var{dev}.  The default device is @samp{ps},
unless changed when @code{groff} was configured and built.  The
following are the output devices currently available:

@table @code
@item ps
For PostScript printers and previewers.

@item pdf
For @acronym{PDF} viewers or printers.

@item dvi
For @TeX{} DVI format.

@item X75
For a 75@dmn{dpi} X11 previewer.

For a 75@dmn{dpi} X11 previewer with a 12@dmn{pt} base font in the
document.

@item X100
For a 100@dmn{dpi} X11 previewer.

@item X100-12
For a 100@dmn{dpi} X11 previewer with a 12@dmn{pt} base font in the
document.

@item ascii
@cindex encoding, output, @acronym{ASCII}
@cindex encoding, output, ISO@tie{}646
@cindex @acronym{ASCII}, output encoding
@cindex ISO@tie{}646, output encoding
@cindex output encoding, @acronym{ASCII}
@cindex output encoding, ISO@tie{}646
For typewriter-like devices using the (7-bit) @acronym{ASCII}
(ISO@tie{}646) character set.

@item latin1
@cindex encoding, output, @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1})
@cindex @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1}), output encoding
@cindex ISO @w{8859-1} (@w{Latin-1}), output encoding
@cindex output encoding, @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1})
For typewriter-like devices that support the @w{Latin-1}
(ISO@tie{}@w{8859-1}) character set.

@item utf8
@cindex encoding, output, @w{UTF-8}
@cindex @w{UTF-8}, output encoding
@cindex output encoding, @w{UTF-8}
For typewriter-like devices that use the Unicode (ISO@tie{}10646)
character set with @w{UTF-8} encoding.

@item cp1047
@cindex encoding, output, @acronym{EBCDIC}
@cindex @acronym{EBCDIC}, output encoding

@cindex encoding, output, code page 1047
@cindex code page 1047, output encoding
@cindex output encoding, code page 1047
@cindex IBM code page 1047 output encoding
For typewriter-like devices that use the @acronym{EBCDIC} encoding IBM
code page 1047.

@item lj4
For HP LaserJet4-compatible (or other PCL5-compatible) printers.

@item lbp
For Canon @acronym{CaPSL} printers (@w{LBP-4} and @w{LBP-8} series laser
printers).

@pindex pre-grohtml
@pindex post-grohtml
@cindex @code{grohtml}, the program
@item html
@itemx xhtml
To produce @acronym{HTML} and @acronym{XHTML} output, respectively.
This driver consists of two parts, a preprocessor (@code{pre-grohtml})
and a postprocessor (@code{post-grohtml}).
@end table

@cindex output device name string (@code{.T})
@cindex output device usage register (@code{.T})
The predefined GNU @code{troff} string @code{.T} contains the name of
the output device; the read-only register @code{.T} is set to@tie{}1 if
this option is used (which is always true if @code{groff} is used to
call GNU @code{troff}).  @xref{Built-in Registers}.

The postprocessor to be used for a device is specified by the
@code{postpro} command in the device description file.  (@xref{Device
and Font Description Files}.)  This can be overridden with the
@option{-X} option.

@item -U
@cindex mode, unsafe
@cindex unsafe mode
Operate in @dfn{unsafe mode}, which enables the @code{open},
@code{opena}, @code{pi}, @code{pso}, and @code{sy} requests.  These
requests are disabled by default because they allow an untrusted input
document to write to arbitrary file names and run arbitrary commands.
This option also adds the current directory to the macro package search
path; see the @option{-m} option above.

@item -w@var{name}
Enable warning @var{name}.  Available warnings are described in
@ref{Debugging}.  Multiple @option{-w} options are allowed.

@item -W@var{name}
Inhibit warning @var{name}.  Multiple @option{-W} options are allowed.

@item -v
Make programs run by @code{groff} print out their version number.

@item -V
Print the pipeline on @code{stdout} instead of executing it.  If
specified more than once, print the pipeline on @code{stderr} and
execute it.

@item -X
Preview with @code{gxditview} instead of using the usual postprocessor.
This is unlikely to produce good results except with @option{-Tps}.

This is not the same as using @option{-TX75} or @option{-TX100} to view
a document with @code{gxditview}: the former uses the metrics of the
specified device, whereas the latter uses X-specific fonts and metrics.

@item -z
Suppress output from @code{gtroff}.  Only error messages are printed.

@item -Z
Do not postprocess the output of @code{gtroff}.  Normally @code{groff}
automatically runs the appropriate postprocessor.

@section Environment
@cindex environment variables
@cindex variables in environment

There are also several environment variables (of the operating system,
not within @code{gtroff}) that can modify the behavior of @code{groff}.

@table @code
@item GROFF_BIN_PATH
@tindex GROFF_BIN_PATH@r{, environment variable}
This search path, followed by @code{PATH}, is used for commands executed
by @code{groff}.

@item GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX
@tindex GROFF_COMMAND_PREFIX@r{, environment variable}
@cindex command prefix
@cindex prefix, for commands
If this is set to@tie{}@var{X}, then @command{groff} runs
@command{@var{X}troff} instead of @command{gtroff}.  This also applies
to @command{tbl}, @command{pic}, @command{eqn}, @command{grn},
@command{chem}, @command{refer}, and @command{soelim}.  It does not
apply to @command{grops}, @command{grodvi}, @command{grotty},
@command{pre-grohtml}, @command{post-grohtml}, @command{preconv},
@command{grolj4}, @command{gropdf}, and @command{gxditview}.

The default command prefix is determined during the installation
process.  If a non-GNU @code{troff} system is found, prefix @samp{g} is
used, none otherwise.

@item GROFF_ENCODING
@tindex GROFF_ENCODING@r{, environment variable}
The value of this environment value is passed to the @code{preconv}
preprocessor to select the encoding of input files.  Setting this option
implies @code{groff}'s command-line option @option{-k} (that is,
@code{groff} always calls @code{preconv}).  If set without a value,
@code{groff} calls @code{preconv} without arguments.  An explicit
@option{-K} command-line option overrides the value of
@env{GROFF_ENCODING}.  See the @cite{preconv@r{(7)}} man page; type
@samp{man preconv} at the command line to view it.

@item GROFF_FONT_PATH
@tindex GROFF_FONT_PATH@r{, environment variable}
A list of directories in which to seek the selected output device's
directory of device and font description files.  GNU @code{troff}
will search directories given as arguments to any specified @option{-F}
options before these, and a built-in list of directories after them.
@xref{Font Directories} and the @cite{troff@r{(1)}} or
@cite{gtroff@r{(1)}} man pages.

@item GROFF_TMAC_PATH
@tindex GROFF_TMAC_PATH@r{, environment variable}
A list of directories in which to seek macro files.  GNU @code{troff}
will search directories given as arguments to any specified @option{-M}
options before these, and a built-in list of directories after them.
@xref{Macro Directories} and the @cite{troff@r{(1)}} or
@cite{gtroff@r{(1)}} man pages.

@item GROFF_TMPDIR
@tindex GROFF_TMPDIR@r{, environment variable}
@tindex TMPDIR@r{, environment variable}
The directory in which @code{groff} creates temporary files.  If this is
not set and @env{TMPDIR} is set, temporary files are created in that
directory.  Otherwise temporary files are created in a system-dependent
default directory (on Unix and GNU/Linux systems, this is usually
@file{/tmp}).  @code{grops}, @code{grefer}, @code{pre-grohtml}, and
@code{post-grohtml} can create temporary files in this directory.

@item GROFF_TYPESETTER
@tindex GROFF_TYPESETTER@r{, environment variable}
Sets the default output device.  If empty or not set, a build-time
default (often @code{ps}) is used.  The @option{-T@var{dev}} option
overrides @env{GROFF_TYPESETTER}.

@item SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
@tindex SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH@r{, environment variable}
A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to use as the
output creation timestamp in place of the current time.  The time is
converted to human-readable form using @cite{ctime@r{(3)}} when the
formatter starts up and stored in registers usable by documents and
macro packages (@pxref{Built-in Registers}).

@item TZ
@tindex TZ@r{, environment variable}
The time zone to use when converting the current time (or value of
@env{SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH}) to human-readable form; see
@cite{tzset@r{(3)}}.
@end table

MS-DOS and MS-Windows ports of @code{groff} use semicolons, rather than
colons, to separate the directories in the lists described above.

Basically, there is no restriction how font files for @code{groff} are
named and how long font names are; however, to make the font family
mechanism work (@pxref{Font Families}), fonts within a family should
start with the family name, followed by the shape.  For example, the
Times family uses @samp{T} for the family name and @samp{R}, @samp{B},
@samp{I}, and @samp{BI} to indicate the shapes `roman', `bold',
`italic', and `bold italic', respectively.  Thus the final font names
are @samp{TR}, @samp{TB}, @samp{TI}, and @samp{TBI}.

@cindex font path
@cindex path, for font files
All font files are kept in the @dfn{font directories}, which constitute
the @dfn{font path}.  The file search functions always append the
directory @code{dev}@var{name}, where @var{name} is the name of the
output device.  Assuming, say, DVI output, and @file{/foo/bar} as a font
directory, the font files for @command{grodvi} must be in
@file{/foo/bar/devdvi}.

The elements of the search path for font files are (in that order):

@itemize @bullet
@item
The directories specified with @code{gtroff}'s or @code{groff}'s
@option{-F} command-line option.  All device drivers and some

@cindex page orientation, landscape

In @code{groff}, the page dimensions for the formatter GNU @code{troff}
and for output devices are handled separately.  @xref{Page Layout}, for
vertical manipulation of the page size, and @xref{Line Layout}, for
horizontal changes.
@pindex papersize.tmac
@pindex troffrc
The @file{papersize} macro package, normally loaded by @file{troffrc} at
startup, provides an interface for configuring page dimensions by
convenient names, like @samp{letter} or @samp{a4}; see
@cite{groff_tmac@r{(5)}}.  The default used by the formatter depends on
its build configuration, but is usually one of the foregoing, as
geographically appropriate.

It is up to each macro package to respect the page dimensions configured
in this way.

For each output driver, the size of the output medium can be set in its
@file{DESC} file.  Most output devices also recognize a command-line
option @option{-p} to override the default dimensions and an option
@option{-l} to use landscape orientation.  @xref{DESC File Format}, for
a description of the @code{papersize} keyword, which takes an argument
of the same form as @option{-p}.  The output driver's man page, such as
@cite{grops@r{(1)}}, may also be helpful.

@code{groff} uses the command-line option @option{-P} to pass options to
postprocessors; for example, use the following for PostScript output on
A4 paper in landscape orientation.

@Example
groff -Tps -dpaper=a4l -P-pa4 -P-l -ms foo.ms > foo.ps
@endExample

@node Invocation Examples,  , Paper Size, Invoking groff
@section Invocation Examples
@cindex invocation examples
@cindex examples of invocation

This section lists several common uses of @code{groff} and the
corresponding command lines.

@Example
groff file
@endExample

@noindent
This command processes @file{file} without a macro package or a
preprocessor.  The output device is the default, @samp{ps}, and the
output is sent to @code{stdout}.

@Example
groff -t -mandoc -Tascii file | less
@endExample

@noindent
This is basically what a call to the @code{man} program does.  GNU
@code{troff} processes the man page @file{file} with the @file{mandoc}
macro file (which in turn loads either the @file{man} or the @file{mdoc}
macro package), using the @command{tbl} preprocessor and the
@code{ascii} output device.  Finally, the @command{less} pager displays
the result.

@Example
groff -X -m me file
@endExample

@noindent
Preview @file{file} with @code{gxditview}, using the @file{me} macro
package.  Since no @option{-T} option is specified, use the default
device (@samp{ps}).  You can say either @w{@samp{-m me}} or
@w{@samp{-me}}; the latter is an anachronism from the early days of
Unix.@footnote{The same is true for the other major macro packages that
come with @code{groff}: @file{man}, @file{mdoc}, @file{ms}, @file{mm},
and @file{mandoc}.  This won't work in general; for example, to load
@file{trace.tmac}, either @samp{-mtrace} or @w{@samp{-m trace}} must be
used.}

@Example
groff -man -rD1 -z file
@endExample

@noindent
Check @file{file} with the @file{man} macro package, forcing
double-sided printing---don't produce any output.

@menu
* grog::
@end menu

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node grog,  , Invocation Examples, Invocation Examples
@subsection @code{grog}

@pindex grog
@code{grog} reads files, guesses which of the @code{groff} preprocessors
and/or macro packages are required for formatting them, and prints the
@code{groff} command including those options on the standard output.  It
generates one or more of the options @option{-e}, @option{-man},
@option{-me}, @option{-mm}, @option{-mom}, @option{-ms}, @option{-mdoc},
@option{-mdoc-old}, @option{-p}, @option{-R}, @option{-g}, @option{-G},
@option{-s}, and @option{-t}.

A special file name@tie{}@file{-} refers to the standard input.
Specifying no files also means to read the standard input.  Any
specified options are included in the printed command.  No space is
allowed between options and their arguments.  The only options
recognized are @option{-C} (which is also passed on) to enable
compatibility mode, and @option{-v} to print the version number and
exit.

For example,

@Example
grog -Tdvi paper.ms
@endExample

@noindent
guesses the appropriate command to print @file{paper.ms} and then prints
it to the command line after adding the @option{-Tdvi} option.  For
direct execution, enclose the call to @code{grog} in backquotes at the
Unix shell prompt:

@Example
`grog -Tdvi paper.ms` > paper.dvi
@endExample

@noindent
As this example shows, it is still necessary to redirect the output to
something meaningful (i.e., either a file or a pager program like
@code{less}).

@c =====================================================================

@node Basics, Common Features, Tutorial for Macro Users, Tutorial for Macro Users
@section Basics
@cindex basics of macros
@cindex macro basics

This section covers some of the basic concepts necessary to understand
how to use a macro package.@footnote{This section is derived from
@cite{Writing Papers with nroff using -me} by Eric P.@tie{}Allman.}
References are made throughout to more detailed information, if desired.

GNU @code{troff} reads an input file prepared by the user and outputs a
formatted document suitable for publication or framing.  The input
consists of text, or words to be printed, and embedded commands
(@dfn{requests} and @dfn{escape sequences}), which tell GNU @code{troff}
how to format the output.  For more detail on this, see @ref{Embedded
Commands}.

The word @dfn{argument} is used in this chapter to mean a word or number
that appears on the same line as a request, and which modifies the
meaning of that request.  For example, the request

@Example
.sp
@endExample

@noindent
spaces one line, but

@Example
.sp 4
@endExample

@noindent
spaces four lines.  The number@tie{}4 is an argument to the @code{sp}
request, which says to space four lines instead of one.  Arguments are
separated from the request and from each other by spaces (@emph{no}
tabs).  More details on this can be found in @ref{Request and Macro
Arguments}.

The primary function of @code{gtroff} is to collect words from input
lines, fill output lines with those words, justify the right-hand margin
by inserting extra spaces in the line, and output the result.  For
example, the input:

@Example
Now is the time
for all good men
to come to the aid
of their party.
Four score and seven
years ago, etc.
@endExample

@noindent
is read, packed onto output lines, and justified to produce:

@quotation
Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their party.
Four score and seven years ago, etc.
@end quotation

@cindex break
@cindex line break
Sometimes a new output line should be started even though the current
line is not yet full; for example, at the end of a paragraph.  To do
this it is possible to cause a @dfn{break}, which starts a new output
line.  Some requests cause a break automatically, as normally do blank
input lines and input lines beginning with a space.

Not all input lines are text to be formatted.  Some input lines are
requests that describe how to format the text.  Requests always have a
period (@samp{.}) or an apostrophe (@samp{'}) as the first character of
the input line.

The text formatter also does more complex things, such as automatically
numbering pages, skipping over page boundaries, putting footnotes in the
correct place, and so forth.

Here are a few hints for preparing text for input to @code{gtroff}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
First, keep the input lines short.  Short input lines are easier to
edit, and @code{gtroff} packs words onto longer lines anyhow.

@item
In keeping with this, it is helpful to begin a new line after every
comma or phrase, since common corrections are to add or delete sentences
or phrases.

@item
End each sentence with two spaces---or better, start each sentence on a
new line.  @code{gtroff} recognizes characters that usually end a
sentence, and inserts inter-sentence space accordingly.

@item
Do not hyphenate words at the end of lines---@code{gtroff} is smart
enough to hyphenate words as needed, but is not smart enough to take
hyphens out and join a word back together.  Also, words such as
``mother-in-law'' should not be broken over a line, since then a space
can occur where not wanted, such as ``@w{mother- in}-law''.
@end itemize

@cindex double-spacing (@code{ls})
@cindex spacing
@code{gtroff} double-spaces output text automatically if you use the
request @w{@samp{.ls 2}}.  Reactivate single-spaced mode by typing
@w{@samp{.ls 1}}.@footnote{If you need finer granularity of the vertical
space, use the @code{pvs} request (@pxref{Changing Type Sizes}).}

A number of requests allow you to change the way the output is arranged
on the page, sometimes called the @dfn{layout} of the output page.

@cindex new page (@code{bp})
The @code{bp} request starts a new page, causing a line break.

@cindex blank line (@code{sp})
@cindex empty line (@code{sp})
@cindex line, empty (@code{sp})
The request @w{@samp{.sp @var{N}}} leaves @var{N}@tie{}lines of blank
space.  @var{N}@tie{}can be omitted (meaning skip a single line) or can
be of the form @var{N}i (for @var{N}@tie{}inches) or @var{N}c (for
@var{N}@tie{}centimeters).  For example, the input:

@Example
.sp 1.5i
My thoughts on the subject
.sp
@endExample

@noindent
leaves one and a half inches of space, followed by the line ``My
thoughts on the subject'', followed by a single blank line (more
measurement units are available, see @ref{Measurements}).

@cindex centering lines (@code{ce})
@cindex lines, centering (@code{ce})
Text lines can be centered by using the @code{ce} request.  The line
after @code{ce} is centered (horizontally) on the page.  To center more
than one line, use @w{@samp{.ce @var{N}}} (where @var{N} is the number
of lines to center), followed by the @var{N}@tie{}lines.  To center many
lines without counting them, type:

@Example
.ce 1000
lines to center
.ce 0
@endExample

@noindent
The @w{@samp{.ce 0}} request tells @code{groff} to center zero more
lines, in other words, stop centering.

@cindex line break (@code{br})
@cindex break (@code{br})
All of these requests cause a break; that is, they always start a new
line.  To start a new line without performing any other action, use
@code{br}.

@cindex features, common

@code{gtroff} provides very low-level operations for formatting a
document.  There are many common routine operations that are done in
all documents.  These common operations are written into @dfn{macros}
and collected into a @dfn{macro package}.

All macro packages provide certain common capabilities that fall into
the following categories.

@menu
* Paragraphs::
* Sections and Chapters::
* Headers and Footers::
* Page Layout Adjustment::
* Displays::
* Footnotes and Annotations::
* Table of Contents::

@end menu

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Paragraphs, Sections and Chapters, Common Features, Common Features
@subsection Paragraphs
@cindex paragraphs

One of the most common and most used capability is starting a paragraph.
There are a number of different types of paragraphs, any of which can be
initiated with macros supplied by the macro package.  Normally,
paragraphs start with a blank line and the first line indented, like the
text in this manual.  There are also block style paragraphs, which omit
the indentation:

@Example
Some   men  look   at  constitutions   with  sanctimonious
reverence, and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too
sacred to be touched.
@endExample

@noindent
And there are also indented paragraphs, which begin with a tag or label
at the margin and the remaining text indented.

@Example
one   This is  the first paragraph.  Notice  how the first
      line of  the resulting  paragraph lines up  with the
      other lines in the paragraph.
@endExample

@Example
longlabel
      This  paragraph   had  a  long   label.   The  first
      character of text on the first line does not line up
      with  the  text  on  second  and  subsequent  lines,
      although they line up with each other.
@endExample

A variation of this is a bulleted list.

@Example
.     Bulleted lists start with a bullet.   It is possible
      to use other glyphs instead of the bullet.  In nroff
      mode using the ASCII character set for output, a dot
      is used instead of a real bullet.
@endExample

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Sections and Chapters, Headers and Footers, Paragraphs, Common Features
@subsection Sections and Chapters

Most macro packages supply some form of section headers.  The simplest
kind is simply the heading on a line by itself in bold type.  Others
supply automatically numbered section heading or different heading
styles at different levels.  Some, more sophisticated, macro packages
supply macros for starting chapters and appendices.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Headers and Footers, Page Layout Adjustment, Sections and Chapters, Common Features
@subsection Headers and Footers

Every macro package gives some way to manipulate the @dfn{headers} and
@dfn{footers} (also called @dfn{titles}) on each page.  This is text put
at the top and bottom of each page, respectively, which contain data
like the current page number, the current chapter title, and so on.  Its
appearance is not affected by the running text.  Some packages allow for
different ones on the even and odd pages (for material printed in a book
form).

The titles are called @dfn{three-part titles}, that is, there is a
left-justified part, a centered part, and a right-justified part.  An
automatically generated page number may be put in any of these fields
with the @samp{%} character (@pxref{Page Layout}).

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Page Layout Adjustment, Displays, Headers and Footers, Common Features
@subsection Page Layout

Most macro packages let the user specify top and bottom margins and
other details about the appearance of the printed pages.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Displays, Footnotes and Annotations, Page Layout Adjustment, Common Features
@subsection Displays
@cindex displays

@dfn{Displays} are sections of text to be set off from the body of the
paper.  Major quotes, tables, and figures are types of displays, as are
all the examples used in this document.

@cindex quotes, major
@cindex major quotes
@dfn{Major quotes} are quotes that are several lines long, and hence
are set in from the rest of the text without quote marks around them.

@cindex list
A @dfn{list} is an indented, single-spaced, unfilled display.  Lists
should be used when the material to be printed should not be filled and
justified like normal text, such as columns of figures or the examples
used in this paper.

@cindex keep
A @dfn{keep} is a display of lines that are kept on a single page if
possible.  An example for a keep might be a diagram.  Keeps differ from
lists in that lists may be broken over a page boundary whereas keeps are
not.

@cindex keep, floating
@cindex floating keep
@dfn{Floating keeps} move relative to the text.  Hence, they are good
for things that are referred to by name, such as ``See figure@tie{}3''.
A floating keep appears at the bottom of the current page if it fits;
otherwise, it appears at the top of the next page.  Meanwhile, the
surrounding text `flows' around the keep, thus leaving no blank areas.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Footnotes and Annotations, Table of Contents, Displays, Common Features
@subsection Footnotes and Annotations
@cindex footnotes
@cindex annotations

There are a number of requests to save text for later printing.

@dfn{Footnotes} are printed at the bottom of the current page.

@cindex delayed text
@dfn{Delayed text} is very similar to a footnote except that it is
printed when called for explicitly.  This allows a list of references to
appear (for example) at the end of each chapter, as is the convention in
some disciplines.

Most macro packages that supply this functionality also supply a means
of automatically numbering either type of annotation.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Table of Contents, Indices, Footnotes and Annotations, Common Features
@subsection Table of Contents
@cindex table of contents
@cindex contents, table of

@dfn{Tables of contents} are a type of delayed text having a tag
(usually the page number) attached to each entry after a row of dots.
The table accumulates throughout the paper until printed, usually after
the paper has ended.  Many macro packages provide the ability to have
several tables of contents (e.g., a standard table of contents, a list
of tables, etc).

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Indices, Paper Formats, Table of Contents, Common Features
@subsection Indices
@cindex index, in macro package

While some macro packages use the term @dfn{index}, none actually
provide that functionality.  The facilities they call indices are
actually more appropriate for tables of contents.

@pindex makeindex
To produce a real index in a document, external tools like the
@code{makeindex} program are necessary.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Paper Formats, Multiple Columns, Indices, Common Features
@subsection Paper Formats
@cindex paper formats

Some macro packages provide stock formats for various kinds of
documents.  Many of them provide a common format for the title and
opening pages of a technical paper.  The @file{mm} macros in particular
provide formats for letters and memoranda.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Multiple Columns, Font and Size Changes, Paper Formats, Common Features
@subsection Multiple Columns

Some macro packages (but not @file{man}) provide the ability to have two
or more columns on a page.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Font and Size Changes, Predefined Strings, Multiple Columns, Common Features
@subsection Font and Size Changes

The built-in font and size functions are not always intuitive, so all
macro packages provide macros to make these operations simpler.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Predefined Strings, Preprocessor Support, Font and Size Changes, Common Features
@subsection Predefined Strings

Most macro packages provide various predefined strings for a variety of
uses; examples are sub- and superscripts, printable dates, quotes and
various special characters.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Preprocessor Support, Configuration and Customization, Predefined Strings, Common Features
@subsection Preprocessor Support

All macro packages provide support for various preprocessors and may
extend their functionality.

For example, all macro packages mark tables (which are processed with
@code{gtbl}) by placing them between @code{TS} and @code{TE} macros.
The @file{ms} macro package has an option, @samp{.TS@tie{}H}, that
prints a caption at the top of a new page (when the table is too long to
fit on a single page).

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Configuration and Customization,  , Preprocessor Support, Common Features
@subsection Configuration and Customization

Some macro packages provide means of customizing many of the details of
how the package behaves.  This ranges from setting the default type size
to changing the appearance of section headers.

@cindex @file{ms} macros

The @file{ms} (``manuscript'') package is suitable for the preparation
of letters, memoranda, reports, and books.  These @code{groff}
macros feature cover page and table of contents generation,
automatically numbered headings, several different paragraph styles, a
variety of text styling options, footnotes, multi-column page layouts,
and indexing.  @file{ms} supports the @command{tbl}, @command{eqn},
@command{pic}, and @command{refer} preprocessors for inclusion of
tables, mathematical equations, diagrams, and standardized bibliographic
citations.  This implementation is mostly compatible with the documented
interface and behavior of AT&T Unix Version@tie{}7 @file{ms}.  Several
extensions from 4.2BSD (Berkeley)
@c Few changes were made in 4.3, Tahoe, Reno, or 4.4.
and Tenth Edition Research Unix have been recreated.

@node ms Introduction, ms Document Structure, ms, ms
@subsection Introduction to @file{ms}

The @file{ms} macros are the oldest surviving package for @code{roff}
systems.@footnote{Although manual pages are even older, the @file{man}
macros originated in Seventh Edition Unix (1979).  @file{ms} shipped
with Sixth Edition (1975) and was documented by Mike Lesk in a Bell Labs
internal memorandum.}  While the @file{man} package was designed for
brief documents to be perused at a terminal, the @file{ms} macros are
also suitable for longer documents intended for printing and possible
publication.

The @file{ms} macro package included with @code{groff} is a complete
re-implementation.  Some macros specific to @acronym{AT&T} or Berkeley
@file{ms} are not included, while several features have been added; see
@ref{Differences from AT&T ms}.

If you're in a hurry to get started, you need only know that @file{ms}
needs one of its macros called at the beginning of a document so that it
can initialize.  A paragraphing macro like @code{PP} (if you want your
paragraph to have a first-line indent) or @code{LP} (if you don't)
suffices.

After that, start typing normally.  You can separate paragraphs with
further paragraphing macros, or with blank lines, and you can indent
with tabs.  When you need one of the features mentioned earlier
(@pxref{ms}), return to this manual.

@CartoucheExample
.LP
Radical novelties are so disturbing that they tend to be
suppressed or ignored, to the extent that even the
possibility of their existence in general is more often
denied than admitted.

@arrow{}That's what Dijkstra said, anyway.
@endCartoucheExample

We have used an arrow @arrow{} in the above to indicate a tab character.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node ms Document Structure, ms Document Control Settings, ms Introduction, ms
@subsection General structure of an @file{ms} document
@cindex @file{ms} macros, general structure

The @file{ms} macro package expects a certain amount of structure:
a well-formed document contains at least one paragraphing or heading
macro call.  To compose a document from scratch, begin it by calling
@code{LP} or @code{PP}.  Longer documents have a structure as follows.

@table @strong
@item Document type
Calling the @code{RP} macro at the beginning of your document puts the
document description (see below) on a cover page.  Otherwise, @file{ms}
places the information (if any) on the first page, followed immediately
by the body text.  Some document types found in other @file{ms}
implementations are specific to @acronym{AT&T} or Berkeley, and are not
supported by @code{groff} @file{ms}.

@item Format and layout
By setting registers and strings, you can change your document's
typeface, margins, spacing, headers and footers, and footnote
arrangment.  @xref{ms Document Control Settings}.

@item Document description
A document description consists of any of: a title, one or more authors'
names and affiliated institutions, an abstract, and a date or other
identifier.  @xref{ms Document Description Macros}.

@item Body text
The main matter of your document follows its description (if any).
@file{ms} supports highly structured text consisting of paragraphs
interspersed with multi-level headings (chapters, sections, subsections,
and so forth) and augmented by lists, footnotes, tables, diagrams, and
similar material.  @xref{ms Body Text}.

@item Tables of contents and indexes
Macros enable the collection of entries for a table of contents (or
index) as the material they discuss appears in the document.  You then
call a macro to emit the table of contents at the end of your document.
The table of contents must necessarily follow the rest of the text since
GNU @code{troff} is a single-pass formatter; it thus cannot determine
the page number of a division of the text until it has been set and
output.  Since @file{ms} was designed for the production of hard copy,
the traditional procedure was to manually relocate the pages containing
the table of contents between the cover page and the body text.  Today,
page resequencing can be done in the digital domain with tools like
@cite{pdfjam@r{(1)}}.  An index works similarly, but because it
typically needs to be sorted after collection, its preparation requires
separate processing.
@end table

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node ms Document Control Settings, ms Document Description Macros, ms Document Structure, ms
@subsection Document control settings
@cindex @file{ms} macros, document control settings

@file{ms} exposes many aspects of document layout to user control via
@code{groff} requests.  To use them, you must understand how to define
registers and strings.

@Defreq {nr, reg value}
Set register @var{reg} to @var{value}.  If @var{reg} doesn't exist, GNU
@code{troff} creates it.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {ds, name contents}
Set string @var{name} to @var{contents}.  If @var{name} exists, it is
removed first.
@endDefreq

A list of document control registers and strings follows.  They are
presented in the syntax used to interpolate them.  For any parameter
whose default is unsatisfactory, define its register or string before
calling any @file{ms} macro other than @code{RP}.

@unnumberedsubsubsec Margin Settings

@Defmpreg {PO, ms}
Defines the page offset (i.e., the left margin).
@c not in V6

Effective: next page.

Default value: 1@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {LL, ms}
Defines the line length (i.e., the width of the body text).

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 6@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {LT, ms}
Defines the title line length (i.e., the header and footer width).  This
is usually the same as @code{LL}, but not necessarily.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 6@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {HM, ms}
Defines the header margin height at the top of the page.
@c not in V6

Effective: next page.

Default: 1@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {FM, ms}
Defines the footer margin height at the bottom of the page.
@c not in V6

Effective: next page.

Default: 1@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@unnumberedsubsubsec Titles (headers, footers)

@Defmpstr {LH, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the left header position.

Effective: next header.

Default: empty.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmpstr {CH, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the center header position.

Effective: next header.

Default: @samp{-\n[%]-}.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmpstr {RH, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the right header position.

Effective: next header.

Default: empty.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmpstr {LF, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the left footer position.

Effective: next footer.

Default: empty.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmpstr {CF, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the center footer position.

Effective: next footer.

Default: empty.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmpstr {RF, ms}
Defines the text displayed in the right footer position.

Effective: next footer.

Default: empty.
@endDefmpstr

@unnumberedsubsubsec Text Settings

@Defmpreg {PS, ms}
Defines the type size of the body text in points.  If the value is
larger than or equal to 1000, it is divided by 1000 to get a fractional
type size.  For example, @samp{.nr PS 10500} sets the document's type
size to 10.5@dmn{points}.  This rescaling of large type sizes is a GNU
extension.  In @file{ms} documents that don't need to be portable to
other implementations, using a scaling indicator, as in @samp{.nr PS
10.5p}, is preferable.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 10@dmn{p}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {VS, ms}
Defines the space between lines (line height plus leading).  If the
value is larger than or equal to 1000, it is divided by 1000 to get a
fractional type size.  This rescaling of large type sizes is a GNU
extension.  See register @code{PS} above.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 12@dmn{p}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {HY, ms}
Defines the automatic hyphenation mode used with the @code{hy} request.
Setting @code{HY} to@tie{}0 is equivalent to using the @code{nh}
request.  This is a Tenth Edition Research Unix extension.
@c possibly 9th, but definitely not Berkeley

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 6.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpstr {FAM, ms}
Defines the font family used to typeset the document.  This is a GNU
extension.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: as defined in the output device.
@endDefmpstr

@unnumberedsubsubsec Paragraph Settings

@Defmpreg {PI, ms}
Defines the indentation amount used by the @code{PP}, @code{IP} (unless
overridden by an optional argument), @code{XP}, and @code{RS} macros.
@c not in V6

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 5@dmn{n}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {PD, ms}
Defines the space between paragraphs.
@c not in V6

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 0.3@dmn{v} (1@dmn{v} on low-resolution devices).
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {QI, ms}
Defines the indentation amount used on both sides of a paragraph set
with the @code{QP} or between the @code{QS} and @code{QE} macros.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 5@dmn{n}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {PORPHANS, ms}
Defines the minimum number of initial lines of any paragraph that must
be kept together to avoid orphaned lines at the bottom of a page.  If a
new paragraph is started close to the bottom of a page, and there is
insufficient space to accommodate @code{PORPHANS} lines before an
automatic page break, then a page break is forced before the start of
the paragraph.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 1.
@endDefmpreg

@unnumberedsubsubsec Heading Settings

@Defmpreg {PSINCR, ms}
Defines an increment in type size to be applied to a heading at a
lesser depth than that specified in @code{GROWPS}.  The value of
@code{PSINCR} should be specified in points with the @dmn{p} scaling
indicator and may include a fractional component; for example,
@w{@samp{.nr PSINCR 1.5p}} sets a type size increment of 1.5@dmn{p}.
This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next heading.

Default: 1@dmn{p}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {GROWPS, ms}
Defines the heading depth above which the type size increment set by
@code{PSINCR} becomes effective.  For each heading depth less than the
value of @code{GROWPS}, the type size is increased by @code{PSINCR}.
Setting @code{GROWPS} to any value less than@tie{}2 disables the
incremental heading size feature.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next heading.

Default: 0.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {HORPHANS, ms}
Defines the minimum number of lines of an immediately succeeding
paragraph that should be kept together with any heading introduced by
the @code{NH} or @code{SH} macros.  If a heading is placed close to the
bottom of a page, and there is insufficient space to accommodate both
the heading and at least @code{HORPHANS} lines of the following
paragraph, before an automatic page break, then the page break is forced
before the heading.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next paragraph.

Default: 1.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpstr {SN-STYLE, ms}
Defines the style used to print numbered headings.  @xref{Headings in
ms}.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next heading.

Default: alias of @code{SN-DOT}
@endDefmpstr

@unnumberedsubsubsec Footnote Settings

@Defmpreg {FI, ms}
Defines the footnote indentation.  This is a Berkeley extension.

Effective: next footnote.

Default: 2@dmn{n}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {FF, ms}
Defines the format of automatically numbered footnotes,
and those for which the @code{FS} request is given a marker argument, at
the bottom of a column or page.  This is a Berkeley extension.
@table @code
@item 0
Set an automatic number as a superscript (on typesetter devices) or
surrounded by square brackets (on terminals).  The footnote paragraph is
indented if there is an @code{FS} argument or an automatic number.  This
is the default.

@item 1
Like @code{0}, but set the marker as regular text and follow an
automatic number with a period.

@item 2
Like @code{1}, but without indentation.

@item 3
Like @code{1}, but set the footnote paragraph with the marker hanging.
@end table

Effective: next footnote.

Default: 0.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {FPS, ms}
Defines the footnote type size in points.  If the value is larger than
or equal to 1000, it is divided by 1000 to get a fractional type size.
This rescaling of large type sizes is a GNU extension.  See register
@code{PS} above.

Effective: next footnote.

Default: @math{@code{@\n[PS]} - 2p}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {FVS, ms}
Defines the footnote vertical spacing.  If the value is larger than or
equal to 1000, it is divided by 1000 to get a fractional type size.
This rescaling of large type sizes is a GNU extension.  See register
@code{PS} above.

Effective: next footnote.

Default: @math{@code{@\n[FPS]} + 2p}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {FPD, ms}
Defines the footnote paragraph spacing.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next footnote.

Default: @math{@code{@\n[PD]} / 2}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpstr {FR, ms}
Defines the ratio of the footnote line length to the current line
length.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next footnote in single-column arrangements, next page
otherwise.

Default: @math{11/12}.
@endDefmpstr

@unnumberedsubsubsec Display Settings

@Defmpreg {DD, ms}
Sets the display distance---the vertical spacing before and after a
display, a @code{tbl} table, an @code{eqn} equation, or a @code{pic}
image.  This is a Berkeley extension.

Effective: next display boundary.

Default: 0.5@dmn{v} (1@dmn{v} on low-resolution devices).
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {DI, ms}
Sets the default amount by which to indent a display started with
@code{DS} and @code{ID} without arguments, to @samp{.DS@tie{}I} without
an indentation argument, and to equations set with @samp{.EQ@tie{}I}.
This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next indented display.

Default: 0.5@dmn{i}.
@endDefmpreg

@unnumberedsubsubsec Other Settings

@Defmpreg {MINGW, ms}
Defines the default minimum width between columns in a multi-column
document.  This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next page.

Default: 2@dmn{n}.
@endDefmpreg

@Defmpreg {TC-MARGIN, ms}
Defines the width of the field in which page numbers are set in a table
of contents entry; the right margin thus moves inboard by this amount.
This is a GNU extension.

Effective: next @code{PX} call.

Default: @code{\w'000'}
@endDefmpreg

@c XXX: Normally we'd have an entry for TC-LEADER here, but it's a
@c special character and we have no custom Texinfo macros for defining
@c (and indexing) these.  There would be little point in an index for
@c one item, and the plan is to drop this entire @section from this

All but the simplest documents bear a title.@footnote{Distinguish a
document title from ``titles'', which are what @code{roff} systems call
headers and footers collectively.}  As their level of sophistication (or
complexity) increases, they tend to acquire dates of revision,
explicitly identified authors, sponsoring institutions for authors, and,
at the rarefied heights, an abstract of their content.  Define these
data by calling the macros below in the order shown; @code{DA} or
@code{ND} can be called to set the document date (or other identifier)
at any time before (a) the abstract, if present, or (b) its information
is required in a header or footer.  Use of these macros is optional,
except that @code{TL} is mandatory if any of @code{RP}, @code{AU},
@code{AI}, or @code{AB} is called, and @code{AE} is mandatory if
@code{AB} is called.

@Defmac {RP, [@code{no}], ms}
Use the ``report'' (@acronym{AT&T}: ``released paper'') format for your
document, creating a separate cover page.  The default arrangement is to
print most of the document description (title, author names and
institutions, and abstract, but not the date) at the top of page@tie{}1.
If the optional @code{no} argument is given, @file{ms} prints a cover
page but does not repeat any of its information on page@tie{}1 (see the
@code{DA} macro below regarding the date).
@endDefmac

@Defmac {TL, , ms}
Specify the document title.  @file{ms} collects text on input lines
following a call to this macro into the title until reaching an
@code{AU}, @code{AB}, or heading or paragraphing macro call.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {AU, , ms}
Specify an author's name.  @file{ms} collects text on input lines
following a call to this macro into the author's name until reaching an
@code{AI}, @code{AB}, another @code{AU}, or heading or paragraphing
macro call.  Call it repeatedly to specify multiple authors.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {AI, , ms}
Specify the preceding author's institution.  An @code{AU} call is
usefully followed by at most one @code{AI} call; if there are more, the
last @code{AI} call controls.  @file{ms} collects text on input lines
following a call to this macro into the author's institution until
reaching an @code{AU}, @code{AB}, or heading or paragraphing macro call.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {DA, [@Var{x} @dots{}], ms}
Typeset the current date, or any arguments @var{x} in the center footer,
and, if @code{RP} is also called, left-aligned after other document
description information on the cover page.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {ND, [@Var{x} @dots{}], ms}
Typeset the current date, or any arguments @var{x}, if @code{RP} is also
called, left-aligned after other document description information on the
cover page.  This is the @code{groff} @file{ms} default.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {AB, [@code{no}], ms}
Begin the abstract.  @file{ms} collects text on input lines following a
call to this macro into the abstract until reaching an @code{AE} call.
By default, @file{ms} places the word ``ABSTRACT'' centered and in
italics above the text of the abstract.  The optional argument @code{no}
suppresses this heading.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {AE, , ms}
End the abstract.

@cindex @file{ms} macros, body text

A variety of macros, registers, and strings can be used to structure and
style the body of your document.  Examples include paragraphs, headings,
footnotes, and inclusions of material such as tables and figures.

The @code{FAM} string sets the font family for body text.  If this
string is undefined at initialization, it is set to @samp{T} (Times).
Setting the @code{FAM} string before the first call of a heading,
paragraphing, or (non-date) document description macro also applies it
to headers, footers, and footnotes.

The hyphenation mode (as used by the @code{hy} request) is set from the
@code{HY} register.

@subsubsection Paragraphs
@cindex @file{ms} macros, paragraph handling

Several paragraph types are available, differing in how indentation
applies to them: to left, right, or both margins; to the first output
line of the paragraph, all output lines, or all but the first.  All
paragraphing macro calls cause the insertion of vertical space in the
amount stored in the @code{PD} register, except at page or column
breaks.  The @code{PORPHANS} register (@pxref{ms Document Control
Settings}) operates in conjunction with each of these macros to inhibit
the printing of orphaned lines at the bottom of any page.

@Defmac {LP, , ms}
Set a paragraph without any (additional) indentation.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {PP, , ms}
Set a paragraph with a first-line left indentation in the amount stored
in the @code{PI} register.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {IP, [@Var{marker} [@Var{width}]], ms}
Set a paragraph with a left indentation.  The optional @var{marker} is
not indented and is empty by default.  It has several applications;
see @ref{Lists in ms}.  @var{width} overrides the indentation amount
stored in the @code{PI} register; its default unit is @samp{n}.  Once
specified, @var{width} applies to further @code{IP} calls until
specified again or a heading or different paragraphing macro is called.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {QP, , ms}
Set a paragraph indented from both left and right margins by the amount
stored in the @code{QI} register.
@endDefmac

@DefmacList {QS, , ms}
@DefmacListEndx {QE, , ms}
Begin (@code{QS}) and end (@code{QE}) a region where each paragraph is
indented from both margins by the amount stored in the @code{QI}
register.  The text between @code{QS} and @code{QE} can be structured
further by use of other paragraphing macros.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {XP, , ms}
Set an ``exdented'' paragraph---one with a left indentation in the
amount stored in the @code{PI} register on every line @emph{except} the
first (also known as a hanging indent).  This is a Berkeley extension.
@endDefmac

The following example illustrates several different paragraphing macros.

@node Headings in ms, Highlighting in ms, Paragraphs in ms, ms Body Text
@subsubsection Headings
@cindex @file{ms} macros, headings

Use headings to create a sequential or hierarchical structure for your
document.  The @file{ms} macros print headings in @strong{bold} using
the same font family and, by default, type size as the body text.
Headings are available with and without automatic numbering.  Text lines
immediately after heading macro calls are treated as part of the
heading, rendered on the same output line in the same style.

@DefmacList {NH, [@Var{depth}], ms}
@DefmacListEnd {NH, @t{S} @Var{heading-depth-index} @dots{}, ms}
Set an automatically numbered heading.

@file{ms} produces a numbered heading the form @var{a.b.c@dots{}}, to
any depth desired, with the numbering of each depth increasing
automatically and being reset to zero when a more significant level is
increased.  ``1''@tie{}is the most significant or coarsest division of
the document.  Only nonzero values are output.  If @var{depth} is
omitted, it is taken to be @samp{1}.

If you specify @var{depth} such that an ascending gap occurs relative to
the previous @code{NH} call---that is, you ``skip a depth'', as by
@samp{.NH 1} and then @samp{.NH 3}---@code{groff} @file{ms} emits a
warning on the standard error stream.

Alternatively, you can give @code{NH} a first argument of@tie{}@code{S},
followed by integers arguments to number the the heading depths

The above results in numbering as follows; the vertical space that
normally precedes each heading is omitted.

6.6.6.  Daimonia

@endExample

@DefmpstrList {SN-STYLE, ms}
@DefmpstrItemx {SN-DOT, ms}
@DefmpstrItemx {SN-NO-DOT, ms}
@DefmpstrListEndx {SN, ms}
After @code{NH} is called, the assigned number is made available in the
strings @code{SN-DOT} (as it appears in a printed heading with default
formatting, followed by a terminating period) and @code{SN-NO-DOT} (with
the terminating period omitted).  These are GNU extensions.

You can control the style used to print numbered headings by defining an
appropriate alias for the string @code{SN-STYLE}.  By default,
@code{SN-STYLE} is aliased to @code{SN-DOT}.  If you prefer to omit the
terminating period from numbers appearing in numbered headings, you may
define the alias as follows.

@Example
.als SN-STYLE SN-NO-DOT
@endExample

@noindent
Any such change in numbering style becomes effective from the next use
of @code{NH} following redefinition of the alias for @code{SN-STYLE}.
The formatted number of the current heading is available in the
@code{SN} string (a feature first documented by Berkeley), facilitating
its inclusion in @code{XS}/@code{XA}/@code{XE} table of contents
entries.
@endDefmpstr

@Defmac {SH, [@Var{depth}], ms}
Set an unnumbered heading.

The optional @var{depth} argument is a GNU extension indicating the
heading depth corresponding to the @var{depth} argument of @code{NH}.
It matches the type size at which the heading is set to that of a
numbered heading at the same depth when the @code{GROWPS} and
@code{PSINCR} heading size adjustment mechanism is in effect.
@endDefmac

If the @code{GROWPS} register is set to a value greater than the
@var{level} argument to @code{NH} or @code{SH}, the type size of a
heading produced by these macros increases by @code{PSINCR} units over
the size specified by @code{PS} multiplied by the difference of
@code{GROWPS} and @var{level}.  The value stored in @code{PSINCR} is
interpreted in @code{groff} basic units; the @code{p} scaling indicator
should be employed when assigning a value specified in points.  For
example, the sequence

@CartoucheExample
.nr PS 10
.nr GROWPS 3
.nr PSINCR 1.5p
.NH 1
Carnivora
.NH 2
Felinae
.NH 3
Felis catus
.SH 2
Machairodontinae
@endCartoucheExample

@noindent
will cause ``1. Carnivora'' to be printed in 13-point text, followed by
``1.1. Felinae'' in 11.5-point text, while ``1.1.1. Felis catus'' and
all more deeply nested heading levels will remain in the 10-point text
specified by the @code{PS} register.  ``Machairodontinae'' is printed at
11.5 points, since it corresponds to heading level@tie{}2.

The @code{HORPHANS} register operates in conjunction with the @code{NH}
and @code{SH} macros to inhibit the printing of orphaned headings at the
bottom of a page; it specifies the minimum number of lines of an
immediately subsequent paragraph that must be kept on the same page as
the heading.  If insufficient space remains on the current page to
accommodate the heading and this number of lines of paragraph text, a
page break is forced before the heading is printed.  Any display macro
or @code{tbl}, @code{pic}, or @code{eqn} region between the heading and
the subsequent paragraph suppresses this grouping.

@subsubsection Highlighting
@cindex @file{ms} macros, highlighting

The @file{ms} macros provide a variety of methods to highlight or
emphasize text.

@Defmac {B, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post} [@Var{pre}]]], ms}
Sets its first argument in @strong{bold type}.  If you specify a second
argument, @code{groff} @file{ms} prints it in the previous font after
the bold text, with no intervening space (this allows you to set
punctuation after the highlighted text without highlighting the
punctuation).  Similarly, it prints the third argument (if any) in the
previous font @emph{before} the first argument.  For example,

@Example
.B foo ) (
@endExample

prints @samp{(@strong{foo})}.

If you give this macro no arguments, @code{groff} @file{ms} prints all
text following in bold until the next highlighting, paragraphing, or
heading macro.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {R, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post} [@Var{pre}]]], ms}
Sets its first argument in roman (or regular) type.  It operates
similarly to the @code{B}@tie{}macro otherwise.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {I, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post} [@Var{pre}]]], ms}
Sets its first argument in @emph{italic type}.  It operates similarly
to the @code{B}@tie{}macro otherwise.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {BI, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post} [@Var{pre}]]], ms}
Sets its first argument in bold italic type.  It operates similarly to
the @code{B}@tie{}macro otherwise.  This is a Tenth Edition Research
Unix extension.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {CW, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post} [@Var{pre}]]], ms}
Sets its first argument in a @code{constant-width} (monospaced)
roman typeface.  It operates similarly to the @code{B}@tie{}macro
otherwise.  This is a Tenth Edition Research Unix extension.
@c possibly 9th, but definitely not Berkeley
@endDefmac

@Defmac {BX, [@Var{txt}], ms}
Typeset @var{txt} and draw a box around it.  On terminal devices,
reverse video is used instead.  If you want the argument to contain
space, use non-breaking space escape sequences of appropriate width
(@code{\~}, @code{\^}, @code{\|}, @code{\0}) or @code{\h}.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {UL, [@Var{txt} [@Var{post}]], ms}
Typeset @var{txt} with an underline.  If you specify @var{post},
@file{ms} sets it in the previous font after the underlined text, with
no intervening space.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {LG, , ms}
Set all subsequent text in larger type (two points larger than the
current size) until the next font size, highlighting, paragraphing, or
heading macro.  You can specify this macro multiple times to enlarge the
type size as needed.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {SM, , ms}
Set all subsequent text in smaller type (two points smaller than the
current size) until the next type size, highlighting, paragraphing, or
heading macro.  You can specify this macro multiple times to reduce the
type size as needed.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {NL, , ms}
Set all text following at the normal type size (that is, the value of
the @code{PS} register).
@endDefmac

@code{groff} @file{ms} also supports strings to begin and end super- and
subscripting.  These are all GNU extensions.

@DefmpstrList {@lbracechar{}, ms}
@DefmpstrListEndx {@rbracechar{}, ms}
Begin and end superscripting, respectively.
@endDefmpstr

@DefmpstrList {<, ms}
@DefmpstrListEndx {>, ms}
Begin and end subscripting, respectively.
@endDefmpstr

Rather than calling the @code{CW} macro, in @code{groff} @file{ms} you
might prefer to change the font family to Courier---a monospaced
typeface---by setting the @code{FAM} string to @samp{C}.  You can then
use all four style macros above, returning to the default family (Times)
with @samp{.ds FAM T}.  Because changes to @code{FAM} take effect only
at the next paragraph, @code{CW} remains useful to ``inline'' a change
to the font family, similarly to the practice of this document in noting
syntactical elements of @file{ms} and @code{groff}.

@endExample

In the previous example, observe how the @code{IP} macro places the
definition on the same line as the term if it has enough space.  If this
is not what you want, there are a few workarounds we will illustrate by
modifying the example.  First, you can use a @code{br} request to force
a break after printing the term or label.

@CartoucheExample
.IP guns
.br
Firearms,
@endCartoucheExample

Second, you could apply the @code{\p} escape sequence to force a break.
The space following the escape sequence is important; if you omit it,
@code{groff} prints the first word of the paragraph text on the same
line as the term or label (if it fits) @emph{then} breaks the line.

@CartoucheExample
.IP guns
\p Firearms,
@endCartoucheExample

Finally, you may append unbreakable horizontal space to the term or
label with the @code{\h} escape sequence; using the same amount as the
indentation will ensure that it's too wide for @code{groff} to treat it
as ``fitting'' on the same line as the paragraph text.

@CartoucheExample
.IP guns\h'0.4i'
Firearms,
@endCartoucheExample

In each case, the result is the same.

@Example
A glossary-style list:

@subsubsection Keeps, boxed keeps, and displays
@cindex @file{ms} macros, displays
@cindex @file{ms} macros, keeps
@cindex keeps [@file{ms}]

On occasion, you may want to @dfn{keep} several lines of text, or a
region of a document, together on a single page, preventing an automatic
page break within certain boundaries.  This can cause a page break to
occur earlier than it normally would.  For example, you may want to keep
two paragraphs together, or a paragraph that refers to a table, list, or
figure adjacent to the item it discusses.  The @file{ms} macros provide
the @code{KS} and @code{KE} macros for this purpose.

You can alternatively specify a @dfn{floating keep}; if a keep cannot
fit on the current page, @file{ms} holds its contents and
allows material following the keep (in the source document) to fill the
remainder of the current page.  When the page breaks, whether by an
explicit @code{bp} request or by reaching the end of the page, @file{ms}
puts the floating keep at the beginning of the next page.  This is
useful for placing large graphics or tables that do not need to appear
exactly where they occur in the source document.

@DefmacList {KS, , ms}
@DefmacItemx {KF, , ms}
@DefmacListEndx {KE, , ms}
@code{KS} begins a keep, @code{KF} a floating keep, and @code{KE} ends a
keep of either kind.
@endDefmac

As an alternative to the keep mechanism, the @code{ne} request forces a
page break if there is not at least the amount of vertical space
specified in its argument remaining on the page (@pxref{Page Control}).
One application of @code{ne} is to reserve space on the page for a
figure or illustration to be included later.

@cindex boxes [@file{ms}]
A keep can also be @dfn{boxed}.  Text in a box is automatically placed
in a diversion (keep).

@DefmacList {B1, , ms}
@DefmacListEndx {B2, , ms}
@code{B1} begins a keep with a box drawn around it.  @code{B2} ends a
boxed keep.
@endDefmac

Box macros cause line breaks; if you need to box a word or phrase within
a line, see the @code{BX} macro in @ref{Highlighting in ms}.  Box lines
are drawn as close as possible to the text they enclose so that they are
usable within paragraphs.  If you wish to box one or more paragraphs,
you may improve the appearance by calling @code{B1} after the first
paragraphing macro, and by adding a small amount of vertical space
before calling @code{B2}.

@c Wrap example at 56 columns.
@CartoucheExample
.LP
.B1
.I Warning:
Happy Fun Ball may suddenly accelerate to dangerous
speeds.
.sp \n[PD]/2
.B2
@endCartoucheExample

If you want a box to float, you will need to enclose the @code{B1} and
@code{B2} calls within a pair of @code{KF} and @code{KE} calls.

@cindex displays [@file{ms}]
@dfn{Displays} turn off filling; lines of verse or program code are
shown with their lines broken as in the source document without
requiring @code{br} requests between lines.  Displays can be kept on a
single page or allowed to break across pages.  The @code{DS} macro
begins a kept display of the layout specified in its first argument;
non-kept displays are begun with dedicated macros corresponding to their
layout.

@DefmacList {DS, @t{L}, ms}
@DefmacListEndx {LD, , ms}
Begin (@code{DS}:@: kept) left-aligned display.
@endDefmac

@DefmacList {DS, [@t{I} [@Var{indent}]], ms}
@DefmacListEndx {ID, [@Var{indent}], ms}
Begin (@code{DS}:@: kept) display indented by @var{indent} if specified,
and by the amount of the @code{DI} register otherwise.
@endDefmac

@DefmacList {DS, @t{B}, ms}
@DefmacListEndx {BD, , ms}
Begin a (@code{DS}:@: kept) a block display:@: the entire display is
left-aligned, but indented such that the longest line in the display
is centered on the page.
@endDefmac

@DefmacList {DS, @t{C}, ms}
@DefmacListEndx {CD, , ms}
Begin a (@code{DS}:@: kept) centered display:@: each line in the display
is centered.
@endDefmac

@DefmacList {DS, @t{R}, ms}
@DefmacListEndx {RD, , ms}
Begin a (@code{DS}:@: kept) right-aligned display.  This is a GNU
extension.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {DE, , ms}
End any display.
@endDefmac

The distance stored in the @code{DD} register is inserted before and
after each pair of display macros; this is a Berkeley extension.  The
@code{DI} register is a GNU extension; its value is an indentation
applied to displays created with @samp{.DS} and @samp{.ID} without
arguments, to @samp{.DS I} without an indentation argument, and to
indented equations set with @samp{.EQ}.  Changes to either register take
effect at the next display boundary.

arbitrary user-specified text.

Place an automatically numbered footnote marker in the text.  Each time
this string is interpolated, the number it produces increments by one.
Automatic footnote numbers start at 1.  This is a Berkeley extension.

@DefmacList {FS, [@Var{marker}], ms}
@DefmacListEndx {FE, , ms}
Begin (@code{FS}) and end (@code{FE}) a footnote.  @code{FS} calls
@code{FS-MARK} with any supplied @var{marker} argument, which is then
also placed at the beginning of the footnote text.  If @var{marker} is
omitted, the next pending automatic footnote number enqueued by
interpolation of the @code{*} string is used, and if none exists,
nothing is prefixed.
@endDefmac

You may not desire automatically numbered footnotes in spite of their
convenience.  You can indicate a footnote with a symbol or other text by
specifying its marker at the appropriate place (for example, by using
@code{\[dg]} for the dagger glyph) @emph{and} as an argument to the
@code{FS} macro.  Such manual marks should be repeated as arguments to
@code{FS} or as part of the footnote text to disambiguate their
correspondence.  You may wish to use @code{\*@{} and @code{\*@}} to
superscript the marker at the anchor point, in the footnote text, or
both.

@code{groff} @file{fs} provides a hook macro, @code{FS-MARK}, for
user-determined operations to be performed when the @code{FS} macro is
called.  It is passed the same arguments as @code{FS} itself.  An
application of @code{FS-MARK} is anchor placement for a hyperlink
reference, so that a footnote can link back to its referential
context.@footnote{``Portable Document Format Publishing with GNU
Troff'', @file{pdfmark.ms} in the @code{groff} distribution, uses this
technique.}  By default, this macro has an empty definition.
@code{FS-MARK} is a GNU extension.

Footnotes can be safely used within keeps and displays, but you should
avoid using automatically numbered footnotes within floating keeps.  You
can place a second @code{\**} interpolation between a @code{\**} and its
corresponding @code{FS} call as long as each @code{FS} call occurs
@emph{after} the corresponding @code{\**} and the occurrences of
@code{FS} are in the same order as the corresponding occurrences of
@code{\**}.

Footnote text is formatted as paragraphs are, using analogous
parameters.  The registers @code{FI}, @code{FPD}, @code{FPS}, and
@code{FVS} correspond to @code{PI}, @code{PD}, @code{PS}, and @code{CS},
respectively.

The @code{FF} register controls the formatting of automatically numbered
footnotes and those for which @code{FS} is given a marker argument.
@xref{ms Document Control Settings}.

The default footnote line length is 11/12ths of the normal line length
for compatibility with the expectations of historical @file{ms}
documents; you may wish to set the @code{FR} string to @samp{1} to align
with contemporary typesetting practices.  In the
past,@footnote{Unix Version@tie{}7 @file{ms}, its descendants, and GNU
@file{ms} prior to @code{groff} version 1.23.0} an @code{FL} register
was used for the line length in footnotes; however, setting this
register at document initialization time had no effect on the footnote
line length in multi-column arrangements.@footnote{You could reset it
after each call to @code{.1C}, @code{.2C}, or @code{.MC}.}

@code{FR} should be used in preference to the old @code{FL} register in
contemporary documents.  The footnote line length is effectively
computed as @samp{@slanted{column-width} * \*[FR]}.  If an absolute
footnote line length is required, recall that arithmetic expressions in
@code{roff} languages are evaluated strictly from left to right, with no
operator precedence (parentheses are honored).

There are multiple ways to produce headers and footers.  One is to

center, and right headers, respectively; and @code{LF}, @code{CF}, and
@code{RF} to set the left, center, and right footers similarly.  This
approach works best for documents that do not distinguish odd and even
pages.

Another method is to call macros with arguments that set headers or
footers for odd or even pages; these variables produce four
combinations, so four macros are available.  Each takes a delimiter
separating the left, center, and right header or footer texts from each
other.  You can replace the neutral apostrophes (@code{'}) with any
character not appearing in the header or footer text.  These macros are
Berkeley extensions.

The @code{OH} and @code{EH} macros define headers for the odd and even
pages; the @code{OF} and @code{EF} macros define footers for the odd and
even pages.
@endDefmac

By default, @file{ms} places no header on any page numbered ``1''
(regardless of its assigned format).

@Defmac {P1, , ms}
Typeset the header even on page@tie{}1.  To be effective, this macro
must be called before the header trap is sprung on any page numbered
``1''; in practice, unless your page numbering is unusual, this means
that you should call it early, before @code{TL} or any heading or
paragraphing macro.  This is a Berkeley extension.
@endDefmac

For even greater flexibility, @file{ms} is designed to permit the
redefinition of the macros that are called when the @code{groff} traps
that ordinarily cause the headers and footers to be output are sprung.
@code{PT} (``page trap'') is called by @file{ms} when the header is to
be written, and @code{BT} (``bottom trap'') when the footer is to be.
The page location trap that @file{ms} sets up to format the header also
calls the (normally undefined) @code{HD} macro after @code{PT}; you can
define @code{HD} if you need additional processing after setting the
header (for example, to draw a line below it).  The @code{HD} hook is a
Berkeley extension.  Any such macros you (re)define must implement any
desired specialization for odd-, even-, or first-numbered pages.

the width of each column and @var{gutter-width} is the minimum distance
between columns.  The @code{MINGW} register stores the default minimum

@subsubsection Creating a table of contents
@cindex @file{ms} macros, creating table of contents
@cindex table of contents, creating [@file{ms}]

Because @code{roff} formatters process their input in a single pass,
material on page 50, for example, cannot influence what appears on
page@tie{}1---this poses a challenge for a table of contents at its
traditional location in front matter, if you wish to avoid manually
maintaining it.  @file{ms} enables the collection of material to be
presented in the table of contents as it appears, saving its page number
along with it, and then emitting the collected contents on demand toward
the end of the document.  The table of contents can then be resequenced
to its desired location as part of post-processing---with a PDF page
relocation tool, or by physically rearranging the pages of a printed
document, depending on the output format and circumstances.

Define an entry to appear in the table of contents by bracketing its
text between calls to the @code{XS} and @code{XE} macros.  A typical
application is to call them immediately after @code{NH} or @code{SH} and
repeat the heading text within them.  The @code{XA} macro, used within
@samp{.XS}/@samp{.XE} pairs, supplements an entry---for instance, when
it requires multiple output lines, whether because a heading is too long
to fit or because style dictates that page numbers not be repeated.  You
may wish to indent the text thus wrapped to correspond to its heading
depth; this can be done in the entry text by prefixing it with tabs or
horizontally spacing escape sequences, or by providing a second argument
to the @code{XA} macro.

@code{XS} and @code{XA} automatically associate the page number where
they are called with the text following them, but they accept arguments
to override this behavior.  At the end of the document, call @code{TC}
or @code{PX} to emit the table of contents; @code{TC} resets the page
number to @samp{i} (Roman numeral one), and then calls @code{PX}.

All of these macros are Berkeley extensions.

@DefmacList {XS, [@Var{page-number}], ms}
@DefmacItemx {XA, [@Var{page-number} [@Var{indentation}]], ms}
@DefmacListEndx {XE, , ms}
Begin, supplement, and end a table of contents entry.  Each entry is
associated with @var{page-number} (otherwise the current page number); a
@var{page-number} of @samp{no} prevents a leader and page number from
being emitted for that entry.  Use of @code{XA} within
@code{XS}/@code{XE} is optional; it can be repeated.  If
@var{indentation} is present, a supplemental entry is indented by that
amount; ens are assumed if no unit is indicated.  Text on input lines
between @code{XS} and @code{XE} is stored for later recall by @code{PX}.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {PX, [@code{no}], ms}
Switch to single-column layout.  Unless @code{no} is specified, center
and interpolate the @code{TOC} string in bold and two points larger than
the body text.  Emit the table of contents entries.
@endDefmac

@Defmac {TC, [@code{no}], ms}
Set the page number to@tie{}1, the page number format to lowercase Roman
numerals, and call @code{PX} (with a @code{no} argument, if present).
@endDefmac

You can customize the style of the leader that bridges each table of
contents entry with its page number; define the @code{TC-LEADER} special
character by using the @code{char} request.  A typical leader combines
the dot glyph @samp{.} with a horizontal space escape sequence to spread
the dots.  The width of the page number field is stored in the
@code{TC-MARGIN} register.

Here's an example of typical @file{ms} table of contents preparation.

Provins's ``Groff and Friends HOWTO'' includes a @code{sed} script that
automatically inserts @code{XS} and @code{XE} entries after each heading
in a document.  Altering the @code{NH} macro to automatically build the
table of contents is perhaps initially more difficult, but could save a
great deal of time in the long run if you use @file{ms} regularly.

@subsection Differences from @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms}
@cindex @file{ms} macros, @code{groff} differences from @acronym{AT&T}
@cindex @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms}, macro package differences

The @code{groff} @file{ms} macros are a complete re-implementation,
using no original @acronym{AT&T} code.  Since they take advantage of the
extended features of @code{groff}, they cannot be used with
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.  @code{groff} @file{ms} supports several
features described above as Berkeley and Tenth Edition Research Unix
extensions, and adds several of its own.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The internals of @code{groff} @file{ms} differ from the internals of
@acronym{AT&T} @file{ms}.  Documents that depend upon implementation
details of @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms} may not format properly with
@code{groff} @file{ms}.  Such details include macros whose function was
not documented in the @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms}
manual.@footnote{@cite{Typing Documents on the UNIX System: Using the
-ms Macros with Troff and Nroff}, M.@: E.@: Lesk, Bell Laboratories,
1978}
@c XXX: We support RT anyway; maybe we should stop?

@item
The general error-handling policy of @code{groff} @file{ms} is to detect
and report errors, rather than silently to ignore them.

@item
@code{groff} @file{ms} does not work in GNU @code{troff}'s
@acronym{AT&T} compatibility mode.  If loaded when that mode is enabled,
it aborts processing with a diagnostic message.

@item
Multiple line spacing is not supported.  Use a larger vertical spacing
instead.

@item
@code{groff} @file{ms} uses the same header and footer defaults in both
@code{nroff} and @code{troff} modes as @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms} does in
@code{troff} mode; @acronym{AT&T}'s default in @code{nroff} mode is to
put the date, in U.S.@: traditional format (e.g., ``January 1, 2021''),
in the center footer (the @code{CF} string).

@item
Many @code{groff} @file{ms} macros, including those for paragraphs,
headings, and displays, cause a reset of paragraph rendering parameters,
and may change the indentation; they do so not by incrementing or
decrementing it, but by setting it absolutely.  This can cause problems
for documents that define additional macros of their own that try to
manipulate indentation.  The solution is to use, not the @code{in}
request, but the @file{ms} @code{RS} and @code{RE} macros.

@item
To make @code{groff} @file{ms} use the default page offset (which also
specifies the left margin), the @code{PO} register must stay undefined
until the first @file{ms} macro is called.  This implies that the
@code{PO} register should not be used early in the document unless it is
changed also: accessing an undefined register automatically defines it.

@item
Right-aligned displays are available.  The @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms}
manual observes that ``it is tempting to assume that @samp{.DS R} will
right adjust lines, but it doesn't work''.  In @code{groff} @file{ms},
it does.

@item
@code{groff} @file{ms} supports the @code{PN} register, but it is not
necessary; you can access the page number via the usual @code{%}
register and invoke the @code{af} request to assign a different format
to it if desired.@footnote{If you redefine the @file{ms} @code{PT} macro
@c I wouldn't mention that, but Lesk 1978 encourages doing so.  :-/
and desire special treatment of certain page numbers (like @samp{1}),
you may need to handle a non-Arabic page number format, as @code{groff}
@file{ms}'s @code{PT} does; see the macro package source.  @code{groff}
@file{ms} aliases the @code{PN} register to @code{%}.}

@item
The @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms} manual documents registers @code{CW} and
@code{GW} as setting the default column width and ``intercolumn gap'',
respectively, and which applied when @code{MC} was called with fewer
than two arguments.  @code{groff} @file{ms} instead treats @code{MC}
without arguments as synonymous with @code{2C}; there is thus no
occasion for a default column width register.  Further, the @code{MINGW}
register and the second argument to @code{MC} specify a @emph{minimum}
space between columns, not the fixed gutter width of @acronym{AT&T}
@file{ms}.

@item
The @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms} manual did not document the @code{QI}
register, whereas Berkeley did; @code{groff} @file{ms} accordingly
supports it.
@end itemize

@Defmpreg {GS, ms}
The register @code{GS} is set to@tie{}1 by the @code{groff} @file{ms}
macros, but is not used by the @acronym{AT&T} @file{ms} package.
Documents that need to determine whether they are being formatted with
@code{groff} @file{ms} or another implementation should test this
register.

@section Text
@cindex text, GNU @code{troff} processing

@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} was designed to take input as it would be
composed on a typewriter, including the teletypewriters used as early
computer terminals, and relieve the user of having to be concerned
during the drafting process with the precise line length that the final
version of the document would use, where words should be hyphenated, and
how to achieve straight margins on both the left and right sides of the
page.  Early in its development, the program gained the ability to
prepare output for a phototypesetter; a document could then be prepared
for output to either a teletypewriter, a phototypesetter, or both.  GNU
@code{troff} continues this tradition of permitting an author to compose
a single master version of a document which can then be rendered for a
variety of output formats or devices.

@code{roff} input files contain text interspersed with instructions to
control the formatter.  Even in the absence of such instructions, GNU
@code{troff} still processes its input in several ways, by filling,
hyphenating, breaking, and adjusting it, and supplementing it with
inter-sentence space.

@node Filling, Sentences, Text, Text
@subsection Filling

When GNU @code{troff} starts up, it obtains information about the device
for which it is preparing output.@footnote{@xref{Device and Font
Description Files}.}  A crucial example is the length of the output
line, such as ``6.5 inches''.

@cindex word, definition of
@cindex filling
GNU @code{troff} reads its input character by character, collecting
words as it goes, and fits as many words together on an output line as
it can---this is known as @dfn{filling}.  To GNU @code{troff}, a
@dfn{word} is any sequence of one or more characters that aren't spaces,
tabs, or newlines.  Words are separated by spaces, tabs, newlines, or
file boundaries.@footnote{There are also @emph{escape sequences} which
can function as word characters, word separators, or neither---the last
simply have no effect on GNU @code{troff}'s idea of whether an input
character is within a word or not.}  To disable filling, see
@ref{Manipulating Filling and Adjustment}.

@Example
It is a truth universally acknowledged
that a single man in possession of a
good fortune must be in want of a wife.
    @result{} It is a truth universally acknowledged that a
    @result{} single man in possession of a good fortune must
    @result{} be in want of a wife.
@endExample

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Sentences, Hyphenation, Filling, Text
@subsection Sentences
@cindex sentences

A passionate debate has raged for decades among writers of the English
language over whether more space should appear between adjacent
sentences than between words within a sentence, and if so, how much, and
what other circumstances should influence this spacing.@footnote{A
well-researched jeremiad appreciated by @code{groff} contributors on
both sides of the sentence-spacing debate can be found at
@uref{https://web.archive.org@//web@//20171217060354@//http://www.heracliteanriver.com@//?p=324}.}
GNU @code{troff} follows the example of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff};
it attempts to detect the boundaries between sentences, and supplies
additional inter-sentence space between them.

@Example
Hello, world!
Welcome to groff.
    @result{} Hello, world!  Welcome to groff.
@endExample

@cindex end-of-sentence characters
@cindex sentence space
@cindex space between sentences
@cindex French spacing
GNU @code{troff} does this by flagging certain characters (normally
@samp{!}, @samp{?}, and @samp{.}) as potentially ending a sentence.
When GNU @code{troff} encounters one of these @dfn{end-of-sentence
characters} at the end of a line, or one of them is followed by two
spaces on the same input line, it appends an inter-word space followed
by an inter-sentence space in the formatted output.

@Example
R. Harper subscribes to a maxim of P. T. Barnum.
    @result{} R. Harper subscribes to a maxim of P. T. Barnum.
@endExample

In the above example, inter-sentence space is not added after @samp{P.}
or @samp{T.} because the periods do not occur at the end of an input
line, nor are they followed by two or more spaces.  Let's imagine that
we've heard something about defamation from Mr.@: Harper's attorney,
recast the sentence, and reflowed it in our text editor.

@Example
I submit that R. Harper subscribes to a maxim of P. T.
Barnum.
    @result{} I submit that R. Harper subscribes to a maxim of
    @result{} P. T.  Barnum.
@endExample

``Barnum'' doesn't begin a sentence!  What to do?  Let us meet our first
@dfn{escape sequence}, a series of input characters that give
instructions to GNU @code{troff} instead of being copied as-is to output
device glyphs.@footnote{This statement oversimplifes; there are escape
sequences whose purpose is precisely to produce glyphs on the output
device, and input characters that @emph{aren't} part of escape sequences
can undergo a great deal of processing before getting to the output.}
An escape sequence begins with the backslash character @code{\} by
default, an uncommon character in natural language text, and is
@emph{always} followed by at least one other character, hence the term
``sequence''.

@cindex @code{\&}, at end of sentence
The non-printing input break escape sequence @code{\&} can be used after
an end-of-sentence character to defeat end-of-sentence detection on a
per-instance basis.  We can therefore rewrite our input more
defensively.

@Example
I submit that R.\& Harper subscribes to a maxim of P.\&
T.\& Barnum.
    @result{} I submit that R. Harper subscribes to a maxim of
    @result{} P. T. Barnum.
@endExample

Adding text caused our input to wrap; now, we don't need @code{\&} after
@samp{T.} but we do after @samp{P.}.  Consistent use of the escape
sequence ensures that potential sentence boundaries are robust to
editing activities.  Further advice along these lines will follow in
@ref{Input Conventions}.

@cindex special characters
@cindex characters, special
Normally, the occurrence of a visible non-end-of-sentence character (as
opposed to a space or tab) immediately after an end-of-sentence
character cancels detection of the end of a sentence.  For example, it
would be incorrect for GNU @code{troff} to infer the end of a sentence
after the dot in @samp{3.14159}.  However, several characters are
treated @emph{transparently} after the occurence of an end-of-sentence
character.  That is, GNU @code{troff} does not cancel end-of-sentence
detection when it processes them.  This is because such characters are
often used as footnote markers or to close quotations and
parentheticals.  The default set is @samp{"}, @samp{'}, @samp{)},
@samp{]}, @samp{*}, @code{\[dg]}, @code{\[dd]}, @code{\[rq]}, and
@code{\[cq]}.  The last four are examples of @dfn{special characters},
escape sequences whose purpose is to obtain glyphs that are not easily
typed at the keyboard, or which have special meaning to GNU @code{troff}
(like @code{\} itself).@footnote{The mnemonics for the special
characters shown here are ``dagger'', ``double dagger'', ``right
(double) quote'', and ``closing (single) quote''.  See the
@cite{groff_char@r{(7)}} man page.}

@Example

The sets of characters that potentially end sentences or are transparent
to sentence endings are configurable.  See the @code{cflags} request in

@node Hyphenation, Breaking, Sentences, Text
@subsection Hyphenation
@cindex hyphenation

When an output line is nearly full, it is uncommon for the next word
collected from the input to exactly fill it---typically, there is room
left over only for part of the next word.  The process of splitting a
word so that it appears partially on one line (with a hyphen to indicate
to the reader that the word has been broken) with its remainder on the
next is @dfn{hyphenation}.  Hyphenation points can be manually
specified; GNU @code{troff} also uses a hyphenation algorithm and
language-specific pattern files (based on those used in @TeX{}) to
decide which words can be hyphenated and where.

Hyphenation does not always occur even when the hyphenation rules for a
word allow it; it can be disabled, and when not disabled there are
several parameters that can prevent it in certain circumstances.
@xref{Manipulating Hyphenation}.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Breaking, Adjustment, Hyphenation, Text
@subsection Breaking
@cindex break
@cindex implicit line break
@cindex line break, output
@cindex output line break

Once an output line has been filled, whether or not hyphenation has
occurred on that line, the next word read from the input will be placed
on a different output line; this is called a @dfn{break}.  In this
manual and in @code{roff} discussions generally, a ``break'' if not
further qualified always refers to the termination of an output line.
When the formatter is filling text, it introduces breaks automatically
to keep output lines from exceeding the configured line length.  After
an automatic break, GNU @code{troff} adjusts the line if applicable (see
below), and then resumes collecting and filling text on the next output
line.

Sometimes, a line cannot be broken automatically.  This usually does
not happen with natural language text unless the output line length has
been manipulated to be extremely short, but it can with specialized
text like program source code.  We can use @code{perl} at the shell
prompt to contrive an example of failure to break the output line.  The
regular output is omitted below.

@Example
$ perl -e 'print "#" x 80, "\n";' | nroff
    @error{} warning: can't break line
@endExample

The remedy for these cases is to tell GNU @code{troff} where the line
may be broken without hyphens.  This is done with the non-printing break
point escape sequence @samp{\:}; see @ref{Manipulating Hyphenation}.

@cindex blank line
@cindex empty line
@cindex line, blank
@cindex blank line macro (@code{blm})
What if the document author wants to stop filling lines temporarily, for
instance to start a new paragraph?  There are several solutions.  A
blank input line not only causes a break, but by default it also outputs
a one-line vertical space (effectively a blank output line).  This
behavior can be modified; see @ref{Blank Line Traps}.  Macro packages
may discourage or disable the blank line method of paragraphing in favor
of their own macros.

@cindex leading spaces
@cindex spaces, leading and trailing
@cindex trailing spaces on text lines
@cindex leading space macro (@code{lsm})
A line that begins with one or more spaces causes a break.  The spaces
are output at the beginning of the next line without being
@emph{adjusted} (see below); however, this behavior can be modified
(@pxref{Leading Space Traps}).  Again, macro packages may provide other
methods of producing indented paragraphs.  Trailing spaces on text lines
are ignored.@footnote{``Text lines'' are defined in @ref{Requests and
Macros}.}

What if there is no next input word?  Or the file ends before enough
words have been collected to fill an output line?  The end of the file
causes a break, resolving both of these cases.  Certain requests also
cause breaks, implicitly or explicitly.  This is discussed in
@ref{Manipulating Filling and Adjustment}.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Adjustment, Tab Stops, Breaking, Text
@subsection Adjustment

@cindex extra spaces between words
After GNU @code{troff} performs an automatic line break, it then tries
to @dfn{adjust} the line: inter-word spaces are widened until the text
reaches the right margin.  Extra spaces between words are preserved.
Leading and trailing spaces are handled as noted above.  Text can be
aligned to the left or right margins or centered; see @ref{Manipulating
Filling and Adjustment}.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Tab Stops, Input Conventions, Adjustment, Text
@subsection Tab Stops

@cindex horizontal tab character
@cindex tab stops
@cindex stops, tab
@cindex tab character
@cindex character, horizontal tab
GNU @code{troff} translates horizontal tab characters, also called
simply ``tabs'', in the input into movements to the next tab stop.
These tab stops are by default located every half inch measured from the
current position on the input line.  With them, simple tables can be
made.@footnote{``Tab'' is short for ``tabulation'', revealing the term's
origin as a spacing mechanism for table arrangement.}  However, this
method can be deceptive, as the appearance (and width) of the text in an
editor and the results from GNU @code{troff} can vary greatly,
particularly when proportional typefaces are used.

A tab character does not cause a break and therefore does not interrupt
filling.  We use an arrow @arrow{} below to indicate an input tab
character.

@Example
1
@arrow{} 2 @arrow{} 3 @arrow{} 4
@arrow{} @arrow{} 5
@result{} 1         2       3       4                 5
@endExample

GNU @code{troff} provides sufficient facilities for sophisticated table
composition; see @ref{Tabs and Fields}.  There are many details to track
when using such low-level features, so most users turn to the
@cite{tbl@r{(1)}} preprocessor for table construction.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Requests and Macros, Macro Packages, Tab Stops, Text
@subsection Requests and Macros

We have now encountered almost all of the syntax there is in @code{roff}
languages, with an exception already noted several times in passing.
@cindex request
@cindex control character
@cindex control character, no-break
@cindex no-break control character
A @dfn{request} is an instruction to the formatter that occurs after a
control character.  A @dfn{control character} must occur at the
beginning of an input line to be recognized.@footnote{A control
character can also occur in arguments to @code{if}, @code{ie},
@code{el}, @code{nop}, and @code{while} requests.}  The regular control
character has a counterpart, the @dfn{no-break control character}, which
suppresses the break that is implied by some requests.  The default
control characters are the dot (@code{.}) and the neutral apostrophe
(@code{'}), the latter being the no-break control character.  These
characters were chosen because it is uncommon for lines of text in
natural languages to begin with periods or apostrophes.  If you require
a literal period or neutral apostrophe where GNU @code{troff} is
expecting a control character, prefix it with the non-printing input
break escape sequence, @samp{\&}.

@cindex control line
An input line beginning with a control character is called a
@dfn{control line}.
@cindex text line
Every line of input that is not a control line is a @dfn{text
line}.@footnote{The @key{\RET} escape sequence can alter how an input
line is classified; see @ref{Line Continuation}.}

@cindex argument
Requests often take @dfn{arguments}, words (separated from the request
name and each other by spaces) that specify details of the action GNU
@code{troff} is expected to perform.  If a request is meaningless
without arguments, it is typically ignored.

GNU @code{troff}'s requests and escape sequences comprise the control
language of the formatter.  Of key importance are the requests that
define macros.  Macros are invoked like requests, enabling the request
repertoire to be extended or overridden.@footnote{Argument handling in
macros is more flexible but also more complex.  @xref{Request and Macro
Arguments}.}

@cindex macro
@cindex calling a macro
@cindex interpolation
A @dfn{macro} can be thought of as an abbreviation you can define for a
collection of control and text lines.  When the macro is @dfn{called} by
giving its name after a control character, it is replaced with what it
stands for.  The process of textual replacement is known as
@dfn{interpolation}.@footnote{Some escape sequences undergo
interpolation as well.}  Interpolations are handled as soon as they are
recognized, and once performed, a @code{roff} formatter scans the
replacement for further requests, macro calls, and escape sequences.

In @code{roff} systems, the @code{de} request defines a
macro.@footnote{GNU @code{troff} offers additional ones.  @xref{Writing
Macros}.}

@Example
.de DATE
2020-11-14
..
@endExample

@noindent
The foregoing input produces no output by itself; all we have done is
store some information.  Observe the pair of dots that ends the macro
definition.  This is a default; you can specify your own terminator for
the macro definition as the second argument to the @code{de} request.

@Example
.de NAME ENDNAME
Heywood Jabuzzoff
.ENDNAME
@endExample

In fact, the ending marker is itself the name of a macro that will be
called if it is defined by that time.

@Example
.de END
Big Rip
..
.de START END
Big Bang
.END
.START
    @result{} Big Rip Big Bang
@endExample

@noindent
In the foregoing example, ``Big Rip'' printed before ``Big Bang''
because its macro was @emph{called} first.  Consider what would happen
if we dropped @code{END} from the @samp{.de START} line and added
@code{..} after @code{.END}.  Would the order change?

Let us consider a more elaborate example.

@Example
.de DATE
2020-10-05
..
.
.de BOSS
D.\& Kruger,
J.\& Peterman
..
.
.de NOTICE
Approved:
.DATE
by

    @result{} Insert tedious regulatory compliance paragraph here.

    @result{} Approved: 2020-10-05 by D. Kruger, J. Peterman
    @result{}
    @result{} Insert tedious liability disclaimer paragraph here.
    @result{}
    @result{} Approved: 2020-10-05 by D. Kruger, J. Peterman
@endExample

@noindent
The above document started with a series of lines beginning with the
control character.  Three macros were defined, with a @code{de} request
declaring each macro's name, and the ``body'' of the macro starting on
the next line and continuing until a line with two dots @samp{@code{..}}
marked its end.  The text proper began only after the macros were
defined; this is a common pattern.  Only the @code{NOTICE} macro was
called ``directly'' by the document; @code{DATE} and @code{BOSS} were
called only by @code{NOTICE} itself.  Escape sequences were used in
@code{BOSS}, two levels of macro interpolation deep.

The advantage in typing and maintenance economy may not be obvious from
such a short example, but imagine a much longer document with dozens of
such paragraphs, each requiring a notice of managerial approval.
Consider what must happen if you are in charge of generating a new
version of such a document with a different date, for a different boss.
With well-chosen macros, you only have to change each datum in one
place.

In practice, we would probably use strings (@pxref{Strings}) instead of
macros for such simple interpolations; what is important here is to
glimpse the potential of macros and the power of recursive
interpolation.

We could have defined @code{DATE} and @code{BOSS} in the opposite order;
perhaps less obviously, we could also have defined them @emph{after}
@code{NOTICE}.  ``Forward references'' like this are acceptable because
the body of a macro definition is not (completely) interpreted, but
stored instead (@pxref{Copy Mode}).  While a macro is being defined (or
appended to), requests are not interpreted and macros not interpolated,
whereas some commonly used escape sequences @emph{are} interpolated.
@code{roff} systems also support recursive macros---as long as you have
a way to break the recursion (@pxref{Conditionals and Loops}).  For
maintainable @code{roff} documents, arrange your macro definitions to
minimize forward references.

Macro definitions can be collected into @dfn{macro files}, @code{roff}
input files designed to produce no output themselves but instead ease
the preparation of other @code{roff} documents.  There is no syntactical
difference between a macro file and any other @code{roff} document; only
its purpose distinguishes it.  When a macro file is installed at a
standard location and suitable for use by a general audience, it is
often termed a @dfn{macro package}.@footnote{Macro files and packages
frequently define registers and strings as well.}  Macro packages can be
loaded by supplying the @option{-m} option to @command{groff} or

@node Input Encodings, Input Conventions, Macro Packages, Text
@subsection Input Encodings

The @command{groff} front end calls the @command{preconv} preprocessor
to handle most input character encoding issues without troubling the
user.  Direct input to GNU @code{troff}, on the other hand, must be in
one of two encodings it can recognize.

@table @code
@item cp1047

@cindex IBM code page 1047 input encoding
@pindex cp1047.tmac
The code page 1047 input encoding works only on @acronym{EBCDIC}
platforms (and conversely, the other input encodings don't work with
@acronym{EBCDIC}); the file @file{cp1047.tmac} is loaded at startup.

@item latin1
@cindex encoding, input, @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1})
@cindex @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1}), input encoding
@cindex ISO @w{8859-1} (@w{Latin-1}), input encoding
@cindex input encoding, @w{Latin-1} (ISO @w{8859-1})
@pindex latin1.tmac
ISO @w{Latin-1}, an encoding for Western European languages, is the
default input encoding on non-@acronym{EBCDIC} platforms; the file
@file{latin1.tmac} is loaded at startup.
@end table

@noindent
Any document that is encoded in ISO 646:1991 (a descendant of USAS
@w{X3.4-1968} or ``US-ASCII''), or, equivalently, uses only code points
from the ``C0 Controls'' and ``Basic Latin'' parts of the Unicode
character set is also a valid ISO @w{Latin-1} document; the standards
are interchangeable in their first 128 code points.@footnote{The
@emph{semantics} of certain punctuation code points have gotten stricter
with the successive standards, a cause of some frustration among man
page writers; see the @cite{groff_char@r{(7)}} man page.}

The remaining encodings require support that is not built-in to the GNU
@code{troff} executable; instead, they use macro packages.

@table @code

@cindex input encoding, @w{Latin-2} (ISO @w{8859-2})
@pindex latin2.tmac
To use ISO @w{Latin-2}, an encoding for Central and Eastern European
languages, either use @w{@samp{.mso latin2.tmac}} at the very beginning
of your document or use @samp{-mlatin2} as a command-line argument to
@code{groff}.

@item latin5

@cindex input encoding, @w{Latin-9} (ISO @w{8859-15})
@pindex latin9.tmac
ISO @w{Latin-9} is a successor to @w{Latin-1}.  Its main difference from
@w{Latin-1} is that @w{Latin-9} contains the Euro sign.  To use this
encoding, either use @w{@samp{.mso latin9.tmac}} at the very beginning
of your document or use @samp{-mlatin9} as a command-line argument to
@code{groff}.
@end table

Some characters from an input encoding may not be available with a
particular output driver, or their glyphs may not have representation in
the font used.  For terminal devices, fallbacks are defined, like
@samp{EUR} for the Euro sign and @samp{(C)} for the copyright sign.  For
typesetter devices, it usually suffices to install fonts that contain
the necessary glyphs and have compatible metrics with other fonts used
in the document.

@pindex freeeuro.pfa
@pindex ec.tmac
Due to the importance of the Euro glyph in Europe, @code{groff} is
distributed with a PostScript font called @file{freeeuro.pfa}, which
provides various glyph shapes for the Euro.  Thus, the
@w{Latin-9} encoding is supported for the @option{ps} and @option{pdf}
drivers out of the box, while @w{Latin-2} is is not.

Unicode supports characters from all other input encodings; the
@option{utf8} output driver for terminals therefore does as well.  The
DVI output driver supports both the @w{Latin-2} and @w{Latin-9}
encodings if the command-line option @option{-mec} is used as well.
@footnote{The DVI output device defaults to using the Computer Modern
(CM) fonts; @file{ec.tmac} loads the EC fonts instead, which provide
Euro @samp{\[Eu]} and per mille @samp{\[%0]} glyphs.}

@node Input Conventions, , Input Encodings, Text
@subsection Input Conventions
@cindex input conventions
@cindex conventions for input

Since GNU @code{troff} fills text automatically, it is common practice
in @code{roff} languages to avoid visual composition of text in input
files: the esthetic appeal of the formatted output is what matters.
Therefore, @code{roff} input should be arranged such that it is easy for
authors and maintainers to compose and develop the document, understand
the syntax of @code{roff} requests, macro calls, and preprocessor
languages used, and predict the behavior of the formatter.  Several
traditions have accrued in service of these goals.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Break input lines after sentence-ending punctuation to ease their
recognition (@pxref{Sentences}).  It is frequently convenient to break
after colons and semicolons as well, as these typically precede
independent clauses.  Consider breaking after commas; they often occur
in lists that become easy to scan when itemized by line, or constitute
supplements to the sentence that are added, deleted, or updated to
clarify it.  Parenthetical and quoted phrases are also good candidates
for placement on input lines by themselves.  In filled text, spaces and
newlines are interchangeable; place breaks where it aids your purpose.

@item
Set your text editor's line length to 72 characters or
fewer.@footnote{Emacs: @code{fill-column: 72}; Vim: @code{textwidth=72}}
This limit, combined with the previous advice regarding breaking around
punctuation, makes it less common that an input line will wrap in your
text editor, and thus will help you perceive excessively long
constructions in your text.  Recall that natural languages originate in
speech, not writing, and that punctuation is correlated with pauses for
breathing and changes in prosody.

@item
Use @code{\&} after @samp{!}, @samp{?}, and @samp{.} if they are
followed by space, tab, or newline characters and don't end a sentence.

@item
In filled text lines, use @code{\&} before @samp{.} and @samp{'} if they
are preceded by space, so that reflowing the input doesn't turn them
into control lines.

@item
Do not attempt to format the input in a @acronym{WYSIWYG} manner (i.e.,
don't try using spaces to get proper indentation or align columns of a
table).

@item
Comment your document.  It is never too soon to apply comments to
record information of use to future document maintainers (including your
future self).  We thus introduce another escape sequence, @code{\"},
which causes GNU @code{troff} to ignore the remainder of the input line.

@item
Use the empty request---a control character followed immediately by a
newline---to visually manage separation of material in input files.
Many of the @code{groff} project's own documents use an empty request
between sentences, after macro definitions, and where a break is
expected, and two empty requests between paragraphs or other requests or
macro calls that will introduce vertical space into the document.

You can combine the empty request with the comment escape sequence to
include whole-line comments in your document, and even ``comment out''
sections of it.
@end itemize

We conclude this section with an example sufficiently long to illustrate
most of the above suggestions in practice.  For the purpose of fitting
the example between the margins of this manual with the font used for
its typeset version, we have shortened the input line length to 56
columns.  As before, an arrow @arrow{} indicates a tab character.

@cindex geometry, page

@code{roff} systems format text under certain assumptions about the size
of the output medium, or page.  For the formatter to correctly break a
line it is filling, it must know the line length, which it derives from
the page width (@pxref{Line Layout}).  For it to decide whether to write
an output line to the current page or wait until the next one, it must
know the page length (@pxref{Page Layout}).

@cindex device resolution
@cindex resolution, device
@cindex basic units
@cindex units, basic
A device's @dfn{resolution} converts practical units like inches or
centimeters to @dfn{basic units}, a convenient length measure for the
output device or file format.  The formatter and output driver use basic
units to reckon page measurements.  The device description file defines
its resolution and page dimensions (@pxref{DESC File Format}).

@cindex page
A @dfn{page} is a two-dimensional structure upon which a @code{roff}
system imposes a coordinate system with its upper left corner as the
origin.  Coordinate values are in basic units and increase down and to
the right.  Useful ones are therefore always positive and within numeric
ranges corresponding to the page boundaries.

@cindex drawing position
@cindex position, drawing
While the formatter (and, later, output driver) is processing a page, it
keeps track of its @dfn{drawing position}, which is the location at
which the next glyph will be written, from which the next motion will be
measured, or where a geometric primitive will commence rendering.
@cindex text baseline
@cindex baseline, text
Notionally, glyphs are drawn from the text baseline upward and to the
right.@footnote{@code{groff} does not yet support right-to-left
scripts.}  The @dfn{text baseline} is a (usually invisible) line upon
which the glyphs of a typeface are aligned.  A glyph therefore
``starts'' at its bottom-left corner.  If drawn at the origin, a typical
letter glyph would lie partially or wholly off the page, depending on
whether, like ``g'', it features a decender below the baseline.

@cindex page offset
@cindex offset, page
Such a situation is nearly always undesirable.  It is furthermore
conventional not to write or draw at the extreme edges of the page.
Therefore the initial drawing position of a @code{roff} formatter is not
at the origin, but down and to the right of it.  This rightward shift
from the left edge is known as the @dfn{page
offset}.@footnote{@code{groff}'s terminal output devices have page
offsets of zero.}  The downward shift leaves room for a text output
line.

Text is arranged on a one-dimensional lattice of text baselines from the
top to the bottom of the page.
@cindex vertical spacing
@cindex spacing, vertical
@cindex vee
@dfn{Vertical spacing} is the distance between adjacent text baselines.
In ordinary circumstances, this quantity is 120% of the type size.  The
initial drawing position is one unit of vertical spacing below the page
top.  Typographers have a name for this unit:@: ``vee''.

@cindex page break
@cindex break, page
Vertical spacing has an impact on page-breaking decisions.  Generally,
when a break occurs, the formatter moves the drawing position to the
next text baseline automatically.  If the formatter was already writing
to the last line that would fit on the page, advancing by one vee would
place the next text baseline off the page.  Rather than let that happen,
@code{roff} formatters instruct the output driver to eject the page,
start a new one, and reset the drawing position to one vee below the
page top again; this is a @dfn{page break}.

When the last line of input text is also the last output line that can
fit on the page, the break caused by the end of the input file will also
break the page, producing a useless blank one.  Macro packages keep
users from having to confront this difficulty by setting ``traps''
(@pxref{Traps}); moreover, all but the simplest page layouts tend to
have headers and footers, or at least bear vertical margins larger than
one vee.

@c TODO: Add a section here about interpolations and input processing.
@c
@c We need to level up the reader's macro brain from reasoning about
@c interpolation at the scope of input lines to interpolations _within_
@c lines.  It is also a good time to introduce the \n and \* escape
@c sequences to avoid painful, "WTF"-producing forward references later.
@c Some materal from groff_mm(7) might be adaptable to this purpose.
@c
@c Earlier material from @Defesc{\\n}:
@c "This means that the value of the register is expanded in place while
@c GNU @code{troff} is parsing the input line.  Nested assignments (also
@c called indirect assignments) are possible."
@c
@c We can probably drop the term "indirect assignments"; there's nothing
@c special about these--they are a consequence of *roffs' left-to-right
@c parsing and they apply to escape sequences in general.

@cindex machine unit (@code{u})
@cindex measurement unit
@cindex @code{u} unit
@cindex unit, @code{u}
@code{gtroff} (like many other programs) requires numeric parameters to
specify various measurements.  Most numeric parameters@footnote{those
that specify vertical or horizontal motion or a type size} may have a
@dfn{measurement unit} attached.  These units are specified as a single
character that immediately follows the number or expression.  Each of
these units are understood, by @code{gtroff}, to be a multiple of its
@dfn{basic unit}.  So, whenever a different measurement unit is
specified @code{gtroff} converts this into its @dfn{basic units}.  This
basic unit, represented by a @samp{u}, is a device dependent
measurement, which is quite small, ranging from 1/75@dmn{th} to
1/72000@dmn{th} of an inch.  The values may be given as fractional
numbers; however, fractional basic units are always rounded to integers.

Some of the measurement units are independent of any of the current
settings (e.g., type size) of GNU @code{troff}.

Although GNU @code{troff}'s basic unit is device-dependent, it may still
be smaller than the smallest unit the device is capable of producing.
The register @code{.H} specifies how many @code{groff} basic units
constitute the current device's basic unit horizontally, and the
register @code{.V} specifies this value vertically.

@subsection Default Units
@cindex default units
@cindex units, default

Many requests take a default unit.  While this can be helpful at times,
it can cause strange errors in some expressions.  For example, the line
length request expects em units.  Here are several attempts to get a
line length of 3.5@tie{}inches and their results:

@Example
3.5i      @result{}   3.5i
7/2       @result{}   0i
7/2i      @result{}   0i
(7 / 2)u  @result{}   0i
7i/2      @result{}   0.1i
7i/2u     @result{}   3.5i
@endExample

@noindent
Everything is converted to basic units first.  In the above example it
is assumed that 1@dmn{i} equals@tie{}240@dmn{u}, and 1@dmn{m}
equals@tie{}10@dmn{p} (thus 1@dmn{m} equals@tie{}33@dmn{u}).  The value
7@dmn{i}/2 is first handled as 7@dmn{i}/2@dmn{m}, then converted to
1680@dmn{u}/66@dmn{u}, which is 25@dmn{u}, and this is approximately
0.1@dmn{i}.  As can be seen, a scaling indicator after a closing
parenthesis is simply ignored.

@cindex measurements, specifying safely
Thus, the safest way to specify measurements is to always attach a
scaling unit.  To multiply or divide by a dimensionless value, use
@samp{u} as its unit.

@node Numeric Expressions, Identifiers, Measurements, gtroff Reference
@section Numeric Expressions
@cindex numeric expressions
@cindex expressions, numeric

A @dfn{numeric expression} is a syntactic structure, recognized only in
specific contexts, that evaluates to an integral value:@: it can be as
simple as a literal @samp{0} or it can be a complex sequence of register
and string interpolations interleaved with operators.

GNU @code{troff} provides a set of mathematical and logical operators
familiar to programmers---as well as some unusual ones---but supports
only integer arithmetic.@footnote{Provision is made for intepreting and
reporting decimal fractions in certain cases.}  The internal data type
used for computing results is usually a 32-bit signed integer, which
suffices to represent magnitudes within a range of 2
billion.@footnote{If that's not enough, see the @cite{groff_tmac@r{(5)}}
man page for the @file{62bit.tmac} macro package.}

@cindex arithmetic operators
@cindex operators, arithmetic
@opindex +
@opindex -
@opindex *
@opindex /
@opindex %
Arithmetic infix operators perform a function on the numeric expressions
to their left and right; they are @code{+} (addition), @code{-}
(subtraction), @code{*} (multiplication), @code{/} (truncating
division), and @code{%} (modulo).  Overflow and division by zero are
errors and abort evaluation of a numeric expression.
@cindex unary operators
@cindex operators, unary
@opindex -
@opindex +
@cindex @code{if} request, and the @samp{!} operator
@cindex @code{while} request, and the @samp{!} operator

Arithmetic unary operators operate on the numeric expression to their
right; they consist of @code{-} (negation) and @code{+} (assertion---for
completeness; it does nothing outside of special contexts, which are
discussed below).

Let's have a look at the behavior of the modulo and truncating division
operators, and observe the effect of negative operands.

@Example
.nr U 5/2
.nr V (-5)/2
.nr W 5/-2
.nr X 5%2
.nr Y (-5)%2
.nr Z 5%-2
U=\n[U] V=\n[V] W=\n[W] X=\n[X] Y=\n[Y] Z=\n[Z]
    @result{} U=2 V=-2 W=-2 X=1 Y=-1 Z=1
@endExample

@noindent
The sign of the modulo of operands of mixed signs is determined by the
sign of the first.  Division and modulo operators satisfy the following
property:@: given a dividend@tie{}@var{a} and a divisor@tie{}@var{b}, a
quotient@tie{}@var{q} formed by @samp{(a / b)} and a
remainder@tie{}@var{r} by @samp{(a % b)}, then @samp{q * b + r = a}.

@cindex scaling operator
@cindex operator, scaling
@opindex ;
GNU @code{troff} offers a scaling operator, @code{(@var{c};@var{e})},
which evaluates a numeric expression@tie{}@var{e} using@tie{}@var{c} as
the default scaling unit.  If @var{c} is missing, scaling units are
ignored in the evaluation of@tie{}@var{e}.  This operator can save
typing by avoiding the necessity of attaching scaling units to every
operand out of caution.  It can also make macros you write simpler to
use:@: you can choose a sensible default unit in case the user neglects
to supply one.

@Example
.\" Indent by amount given in first argument; assume ens.
.de Indent
.  in (n;\\$1)
..
@endExample

@noindent
Without the scaling operator, the foregoing macro would, if called with
a unitless argument, cause indentation by the @code{in} request's
default scaling unit (ems).  The result would be twice as much
indentation as expected.

@cindex extremum operators (@code{>?}, @code{<?})
@cindex operators, extremum (@code{>?}, @code{<?})
@opindex >?
@opindex <?
GNU @code{troff} also provides a pair of operators to compute the
extrema of two operands: @code{>?} (maximum) and @code{<?} (minimum).

@Example
.nr slots 5
.nr candidates 3
.nr salaries (\n[slots] <? \n[candidates])
Looks like we'll end up paying \n[salaries] salaries.
    @result{} Looks like we'll end up paying 3 salaries.
@endExample

@cindex comparison operators
@cindex operators, comparison
@opindex <
@opindex >
@opindex >=
@opindex <=
@opindex =
@opindex ==
Comparison operators comprise @code{<} (less than), @code{>} (greater
than), @code{<=} (less than or equal), @code{>=} (greater than or
equal), and @code{=} (equal).  @code{==} is a synonym for @code{=}.
When evaluated, a comparison operation is replaced with @samp{0} if it
is false and @samp{1} if true.

@cindex logical operators
@cindex operators, logical
@opindex &
@ifnotinfo
@opindex :
@end ifnotinfo
@ifinfo
@opindex @r{<colon>}
@end ifinfo
With truth values established, we can consider the logical operators
@code{&} (logical conjunction or ``and'') and @code{:} (logical
disjunction or ``or'').
@opindex !
@cindex complementation, logical
@cindex logical complementation operator
@cindex logical not, limitation in expression
@cindex expression, limitation of logical not in
A logical complementation or ``not'' operator, @code{!}, works only
within @code{if} and @code{while} requests.@footnote{@samp{!(-1)}
evaluates to @samp{1} because GNU @code{troff} treats negative numbers
and zero as false.}

Furthermore, @code{!} is recognized only at the beginning of a numeric
expression not contained by another numeric expression.  In other words,
it must be the ``outermost'' operator.  Attempting to include it
elsewhere in the expression results in a warning diagnostic in the
@samp{number} category (@pxref{Debugging}), and its expression evaluates
false.  This unfortunate limitation maintains compatibility with
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.  You can work around it by comparing
numeric expressions to truth values.

@Example
.nr X 1
.nr Y 0
.\" This does not work as expected.
.if (\n[X])&(!\n[Y]) .nop A: X is true, Y is false
.
.\" Use this construct instead.
.if (\n[X])&(\n[Y]=0) .nop B: X is true, Y is false
    @error{} warning: expected numeric expression, got '!'
    @result{} B: X is true, Y is false
@endExample

@code{roff} languages have no operator precedence:@: expressions are
evaluated strictly from left to right, in contrast to schoolhouse
arithmetic.  Use parentheses @code{(} @code{)} to impose a desired
precedence upon subexpressions.

@Example
.nr X 3+5*4
.nr Y (3+5)*4
.nr Z 3+(5*4)
X=\n[X] Y=\n[Y] Z=\n[Z]

For many requests and escape sequences that cause motion on the page,
the unary operators @code{+} and @code{-} work differently when leading
a numeric expression.  They then indicate a motion relative to the
current drawing position:@: positive is down in vertical contexts, right
in horizontal ones.

@cindex @code{\R}, using @code{+} and@tie{}@code{-} with
@cindex @code{\s}, using @code{+} and@tie{}@code{-} with
@code{+} and @code{-} are also treated differently by the following
requests and escape sequences:@: @code{bp}, @code{in}, @code{ll},
@code{lt}, @code{nm}, @code{nr}, @code{pl}, @code{pn}, @code{po},
@code{ps}, @code{pvs}, @code{rt}, @code{ti}, @code{\H}, @code{\R}, and
@code{\s}.  Here, leading plus and minus signs serve as incrementation
and decrementation operators.  @xref{Setting Registers}, for examples.

@cindex @code{|}, and page motion
@cindex ``absolute'' position operator (@code{|})
@cindex position, ``absolute'', operator (@code{|})
@cindex boundary-relative motion operator (@code{|})
@c "motion" and "operators" already indexed above
A leading @code{|} operator indicates a motion relative not to the
current position but to a boundary.  For horizontal motions, the
measurement specifies a distance relative to the drawing position
corresponding to the beginning of the @emph{input} line.  By default,
tab stops reckon movements in this way.  Most escape sequences do not;
@c XXX: Which ones do?
@code{|} tells them to do so.

@Example
Mind the \h'1.2i'gap.
.br
Mind the \h'|1.2i'gap.
.br
Mind the
\h'|1.2i'gap.
@c 13 spaces, 4 spaces, 13 spaces
    @result{} Mind the             gap.
    @result{} Mind the    gap.
    @result{} Mind the             gap.
@endExample

One use of this feature is to define macros whose scope is limited to
the output they format.

@Example
.\" underline word $1 with trailing punctuation $2
.de Underline
.  nop \\$1\l'|0\[ul]'\\$2
..
Typographical emphasis is best used
.Underline sparingly .
@endExample

@noindent
In the above example, @samp{|0} specifies a negative motion from the
current position (at the end of the argument just emitted, @code{\$1})
to the beginning of the input line.  Thus, the @code{\l} escape sequence
in this case draws a line from right to left.  A macro call occurs at
the beginning of an input line;@footnote{Control structure syntax
creates an exception to this rule, but is designed to remain useful:
recalling our example, @samp{.if 1 .Underline this} would underline only
``this'', precisely.  @xref{Conditionals and Loops}.} if the @code{|}
operator were omitted, then the underline would be drawn a zero distance
from the current position, producing device-dependent, and likely
undesirable, results.  On the @samp{ps} output device, it underlines the
period.

For vertical movements, the @code{|} operator specifies a distance from
the first text baseline on the page or in the current diversion, using
the current vertical spacing.

@Example
A
.br
B \Z'C'\v'|0'D
    @result{} A D
    @result{} B C
@endExample

In the foregoing example, we've used the @code{\Z} escape sequence
(@pxref{Page Motions}) to restore the drawing position after formatting
@samp{C}, then moved vertically to the first text baseline on the page.

@Defesc {\\B, @code{'}, anything, @code{'}}
@cindex numeric expression, valid
@cindex valid numeric expression
Interpolate@tie{}1 if @var{anything} is a valid numeric expression,
and@tie{}0 otherwise.
@endDefesc

You might use @code{\B} along with the @code{if} request to filter out
invalid macro or string arguments.  @xref{Conditionals and Loops}.

@Example
.\" Indent by amount given in first argument; assume ens.
.de Indent
.  if \B'\\$1' .in (n;\\$1)
..
@endExample

A register interpolated as an operand in a numeric expression must have
an Arabic format; luckily, this is the default.  @xref{Assigning
Register Formats}.

@cindex space characters, in expressions
@cindex expressions, and space characters
Due to the way arguments are parsed, spaces are not allowed in numeric
expressions unless the (sub)expression containing them is surrounded by
parentheses.  @xref{Request and Macro Arguments}, and @ref{Conditionals
and Loops}.

@Example
.nf
.nr a 1+2 + 2+1
\na
    @error{} expected numeric expression, got a space
    @result{} 3
.nr a 1+(2 + 2)+1
\na
    @result{} 6
@endExample

The @code{nr} request (@pxref{Setting Registers}) expects its second and
optional third arguments to be numeric expressions; a bare @code{+} does
not qualify, so our first attempt got a warning.

@node Identifiers, Embedded Commands, Numeric Expressions, gtroff Reference
@section Identifiers
@cindex identifiers

GNU @code{troff} has rules for properly formed
@dfn{identifiers}---labels for objects with syntactical importance, like
registers, names (macros, strings, or diversions), environments, fonts,
styles, colors, and glyphs.  An identifier consists of one or more
characters with the exception of spaces, tabs, newlines, and invalid
input characters.

@cindex invalid input characters
@cindex input characters, invalid
@cindex characters, invalid input
@cindex Unicode
Invalid input characters are a subset of control characters (from the
sets ``C0 Controls'' and ``C1 Controls'' as Unicode describes them).
When GNU @code{troff} encounters one in an identifier, it produces a
warning in category @samp{input} (@pxref{Debugging}).  They are removed
during parsing; an identifier @samp{foo}, followed by an invalid
character, followed by @samp{bar}, is interpreted as @samp{foobar}.

On a machine using the ISO 646, 8859, or 10646 character encodings,
invalid input characters are @code{0x00}, @code{0x08}, @code{0x0B},
@code{0x0D}--@code{0x1F}, and @code{0x80}--@code{0x9F}.  On an
@acronym{EBCDIC} host, they are @code{0x00}--@code{0x01}, @code{0x08},
@code{0x09}, @code{0x0B}, @code{0x0D}--@code{0x14},
@code{0x17}--@code{0x1F}, and
@code{0x30}--@code{0x3F}.@footnote{Historically, control characters like
ASCII STX, ETX, and BEL (Control+B, Control+C, and Control+G) have been
observed in @code{roff} documents, particularly in macro packages
employing them as delimiters with the output comparison operator to try
to avoid collisions with the content of arbitrary user-supplied
parameters (@pxref{Operators in Conditionals}).  We discourage this
expedient; in GNU @code{troff} it is unnecessary (outside of
compatibility mode) because delimited arguments are parsed at a different
input level than the surrounding context.  @xref{Implementation
Differences}.}  Some of these code points are used by GNU @code{troff}
internally, making it non-trivial to extend the program to cover Unicode
or other character encodings that use characters from these
ranges.@footnote{Consider what happens when a C1 control
@code{0x80}--@code{0x9F} is necessary as a continuation byte in a UTF-8
sequence.}

The identifiers @samp{br}, @samp{PP}, @samp{end-list},
@samp{ref*normal-print}, @samp{|}, @samp{@@_}, and @samp{!"#$%'()*+,-./}
are all valid.  Discretion should be exercised to prevent confusion.
Some care is required with identifiers starting with @samp{(} or
@samp{[}.

@Example
.nr x 9
.nr y 1
.nr (x 2
.nr [y 3
.nr sum1 (\n(x + \n[y])
    @error{} space character not allowed in escape
    @error{}   sequence parameter
A:2+3=\n[sum1]
.nr sum2 (\n((x + \n[[y])
B:2+3=\n[sum2]
.nr sum3 (\n[(x] + \n([y)
C:2+3=\n[sum3]
    @result{} A:2+3=1 B:2+3=5 C:2+3=5
@endExample

@cindex @code{]}, as part of an identifier
@noindent
An identifier with a closing bracket (@samp{]}) in its name can't be
accessed with bracket-form escape sequences that expect an identifier as
a parameter.  For example, @samp{\[foo]]} accesses the glyph @samp{foo},
followed by @samp{]} in whatever the surrounding context is, whereas
@samp{\C'foo]'} formats a glyph named @samp{foo]}.

@cindex @code{refer}, and macro names starting with @code{[} or @code{]}
@cindex @code{[}, macro names starting with, and @code{refer}
@cindex @code{]}, macro names starting with, and @code{refer}
@cindex macro names, starting with @code{[} or @code{]}, and @code{refer}
If you begin a macro, string, or diversion name with either of the
characters @samp{[} or @samp{]}, you foreclose use of the @code{refer}
preprocessor, which recognizes @samp{.[} and @samp{.]} as bilbilographic
reference delimiters.

@Defesc {\\A, @code{'}, ident, @code{'}}
Test whether an identifier @var{ident} is valid in @code{gtroff}.  It
expands to the character@tie{}1 or@tie{}0 according to whether its
argument (usually delimited by quotes) is or is not acceptable as the
name of a string, macro, diversion, register, environment, or font.  It
returns@tie{}0 if no argument is given.  This is useful for looking up
user input in some sort of associative table.

Unlike many other programming languages, undefined identifiers are

@cindex commands, embedded

To support documents that require more than filling, automatic line
breaking and hyphenation, adjustment, and supplemental inter-sentence
space, GNU @code{troff} allows instructions to the formatter to be
embedded into the text.  This is done in two ways.

One is a @dfn{request}, which begins with a control character and takes
up an entire input line.  Requests often perform relatively large-scale
operations such as setting the page length, breaking a line, or starting
a new page.

The other is an @dfn{escape sequence}, which begins with the escape
character and can usually be embedded anywhere in the text, even in
arguments to requests and other escape sequences.  Escape sequences
often implement relatively minor operations like sub- and superscripting
or interpolating a symbol.

Some operations are available via both requests and escape sequences,
such as font selection and type size alteration.

@cindex no-break control character (@code{'})
@cindex character, no-break control (@code{'})
@cindex control character, no-break (@code{'})
A request invocation begins with a control character, which is either a
single quote (@samp{'}, the @dfn{no-break control character}) or a
period (@samp{.}, the normal @dfn{control character}).  These can be
changed; see @ref{Character Translations}, for details.  After this
there may be optional tabs or spaces followed by an identifier, which is
the name of the request.  This may be followed by any number of
space-separated arguments (@emph{no} tabs here).

Since spaces and tabs are ignored after a control character, it is
common practice to use them to structure the source of documents or
macro files.

.de bar
.  tm This is bar.
..
@endExample

@cindex blank line
@cindex blank line macro (@code{blm})
Another possibility is to use the blank line macro request @code{blm} by
assigning an empty macro to it.

@Example
.de do-nothing
..
.blm do-nothing  \" activate blank line macro

.de foo
.  tm This is foo.

@cindex @code{\&}, escaping control characters
To begin a line with a control character without it being interpreted,
precede it with @code{\&}.  This represents a non-printing input break,
which means it does not affect the output.

In most cases the period is used as a control character.  Several
requests cause a break implicitly; using the single quote control
character prevents this.

@Defreg {.br}
A read-only register, which is set to@tie{}1 if a macro is called with
the normal control character (as defined with the @code{cc} request),
and set to@tie{}0 otherwise.

@cindex modifying requests

This allows reliable modification of requests.

@Example
.als bp*orig bp
.de bp

.  tm after bp
..
@endExample

Using this register outside of a macro makes no sense (it always returns
zero in such cases).

If a macro is interpolated as a string (that is, using @code{\*}), the
value of the @code{.br} register is inherited from the caller.
@endDefreg

There is no way to invoke an undefined request; such syntax is
interpreted as a macro call instead.  If a macro of the desired name
does not exist, it is created, assigned an empty definition, and a
warning in category @samp{mac} is produced.  @xref{Debugging}, for
information about the enablement and suppression of warnings.  A call of
an undefined macro @emph{does} end a macro definition naming it as its
end macro (@pxref{Writing Macros}).

@cindex tabs, and macro arguments
@cindex macro arguments, and tabs
@cindex arguments to macros, and tabs
Arguments to requests and macros are separated by space
characters.@footnote{Plan@tie{}9 @code{troff} also allows tabs for
argument separation---GNU @code{troff} intentionally doesn't support
this.}  Only one space between arguments is necessary; additional ones
are harmless and ignored.

@cindex spaces, in a macro argument
A macro argument that must contain space characters can either be
enclosed in double quotes---this is @emph{not} true of requests---or one
of several varieties of @dfn{escape} with a spacing function can be used
instead.

Consider calls to a hypothetical macro @code{uh}:

@Example
.uh The Mouse Problem
.uh "The Mouse Problem"
.uh The\~Mouse\~Problem
.uh The\ Mouse\ Problem
@endExample

@cindex @code{\~}, difference to @code{\@key{SP}}
@cindex @code{\@key{SP}}, difference to @code{\~}
@noindent
The first line is the @code{uh} macro being called with three arguments,
@samp{The}, @samp{Mouse}, and @samp{Problem}.  The remainder call the
@code{uh} macro with one argument, @samp{The Mouse Problem}.  The last
solution, using escaped spaces, is ``classical'' in the sense that it
can be found in documents prepared for @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.
Nevertheless, it is not optimal in most situations, since @w{@samp{\ }}
inserts a fixed-width, non-breaking space character that can't be
adjusted.  GNU @code{troff} provides a different command @code{\~} to
insert a adjustable, non-breaking space.@footnote{@code{\~} is also
supported by Heirloom Doctools @code{troff} 050915 (September 2005),
@code{neatroff} (since commit 1c6ab0f6e, 2016-09-13), and @code{mandoc}

@cindex @code{"}, in a macro argument
@cindex double quote, in a macro argument
A double quote that isn't preceded by a space doesn't start a macro
argument.  If not closing a string, it is printed literally.

For example,

@Example
.xxx a" "b c" "de"fg"
@endExample

@noindent
has the arguments @samp{a"}, @w{@samp{b c}}, @samp{de}, and @samp{fg"}.
Don't rely on this obscure behaviour!

There are two possibilities to get a double quote reliably.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Enclose the whole argument with double quotes and use two consecutive
double quotes to represent a single one.  This traditional solution has
the disadvantage that double quotes don't survive argument expansion
again if called in compatibility mode (using the @option{-C} option of
GNU @code{troff}).

@Example
.de xx
.  tm xx: `\\$1' `\\$2' `\\$3'
.
.  yy "\\$1" "\\$2" "\\$3"
..
.de yy
.  tm yy: `\\$1' `\\$2' `\\$3'
..
.xx A "test with ""quotes""" .
    @result{} xx: `A' `test with "quotes"' `.'
    @result{} yy: `A' `test with ' `quotes""'
@endExample

@noindent
If not in compatibility mode, you get the expected result

@Example
xx: `A' `test with "quotes"' `.'
yy: `A' `test with "quotes"' `.'
@endExample

@noindent
@cindex input level
@cindex level, input
@cindex interpolation depth
@cindex depth, interpolation
since GNU @code{troff} tracks the nesting depth of

@item
Use the double-quote glyph @code{\(dq}.  This works with and without
compatibility mode enabled since GNU @code{troff} doesn't convert
@code{\(dq} back to a double-quote input character.

This method won't work with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} since it doesn't
define the @code{dq} special character.

@subsection Escape Sequences
@cindex escape sequences

Escape sequences may occur anywhere in the input to GNU @code{troff}.
They always begin with the @dfn{escape character}, a backslash by
default, and are followed by a character that indicates the function to
be performed.  To change or disable the escape character, see
@ref{Character Translations}.

Escape sequences that require a parameter accept three possible syntax
forms.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The next single character is the identifier.

@cindex @code{(}, starting a two-character identifier
@item
If this single character is an opening parenthesis, take the following
two characters as the identifier.  There is no closing parenthesis
after the identifier.

If this single character is an opening bracket, take all characters
until a closing bracket as the identifier.

@cindex @code{'}, delimiting arguments
@cindex argument delimiting characters
@cindex characters, argument delimiting

Other escape sequences may require several arguments and/or some special
format.  In such cases the argument is traditionally enclosed in single
quotes (and quotes are always used in this manual for the definitions of
escape sequences).  The enclosed text is then processed according to
what that escape expects.  Example:

@Example
\l'1.5i\(bu'
@endExample

@cindex @code{\o}, possible quote characters
@cindex @code{\b}, possible quote characters
@cindex @code{\X}, possible quote characters
The quote character can be replaced with any other character
that does not occur in the argument (even a newline or a space
character) in the following escape sequences: @code{\o}, @code{\b}, and
@code{\X}.  This makes e.g.

@node Comments,  , Escape Sequences, Escape Sequences
@subsubsection Comments
@cindex comments

One of the most common forms of escape sequence is the
comment.@footnote{This claim may be more aspirational than descriptive.}

@Defesc {\\", , , }
Start a comment.  Everything up to the next newline is ignored.

This may sound simple, but it can be tricky to keep the comments from
interfering with the appearance of the output.
@cindex @code{ds}, @code{ds1} requests, and comments
@cindex @code{as}, @code{as1} requests, and comments
If the escape is to the right of some text or a request, that portion of
the line is ignored, but spaces preceding it are processed normally by
GNU @code{troff}.  This affects only the @code{ds} and @code{as}
requests and their variants.

@cindex tabs, before comments
@cindex comments, lining up with tabs
One possibly irritating idiosyncrasy is that tabs should not be used to
vertically align comments in the source document.  Tab characters are
not treated as separators between a request name and its first argument,
nor between arguments.

@cindex undefined request
@cindex request, undefined
A comment on a line by itself is treated as a blank line, because after
eliminating the comment, that is all that remains.

@Example
Test
\" comment
Test
  @result{} Test
  @result{}
  @result{} Test
@endExample

To avoid this, it is common to combine the empty request with the
comment escape @samp{.\"}, causing the line to be ignored.

@cindex @code{'}, as a comment
Another commenting scheme sometimes seen is three consecutive single
quotes (@code{'''}) at the beginning of a line.  This works, but GNU
@code{troff} emits a warning diagnostic (if enabled) about an undefined
macro (namely @samp{''}).
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\#, , , }
Start a comment; everything up to and including the next newline is
ignored.  This @code{groff} extension was introduced to avoid the
problems described above.

@Example
Test
\# comment
Test
  @result{} Test Test
@endExample

@Defreq {ig, [@Var{end}]}

any),@footnote{@xref{Conditional Blocks}.} the macro @var{end} is called

Numeric variables in GNU @code{troff} are called @dfn{registers}.  Many

register.

@node Setting Registers, Interpolating Registers, Registers, Registers
@subsection Setting Registers
@cindex setting registers (@code{nr}, @code{\R})
@cindex registers, setting (@code{nr}, @code{\R})

Define registers and update their values with the @code{nr} request or
the @code{\R} escape sequence.

@DefreqList {nr, ident value}
@DefescListEndx {\\R, @code{'}, ident value, @code{'}}
Set register @var{ident} to @var{value}.  If @var{ident} doesn't exist,
GNU @code{troff} creates it.

The argument to @code{\R} must be enclosed within delimiters; see
@ref{Escape Sequences}, for a list of valid delimiter characters.  The
@code{\R} escape doesn't produce an input token in GNU @code{troff}; in
other words, it vanishes completely after GNU @code{troff} has processed
it.

For example, the following two lines are equivalent:

@Example
.nr a (((17 + (3 * 4))) % 4)
\R'a (((17 + (3 * 4))) % 4)'
    @result{} 1
@endExample

(Later, we will discuss additional forms of @code{nr} and @code{\R} that
can change a register's value after it is dereferenced but before it is
interpolated.  @xref{Auto-increment}.)

The complete transparency of @code{\R} can cause surprising effects if
you use registers like @code{.k}, which get evaluated at the time they
are accessed.

@Example
.ll 1.6i
.
aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff ggg hhh\R':k \n[.k]'
.tm :k == \n[:k]
    @result{} :k == 126950
.
.br
.
aaa bbb ccc ddd eee fff ggg hhh\h'0'\R':k \n[.k]'
.tm :k == \n[:k]
    @result{} :k == 15000
@endExample

If you process this with the PostScript device (@code{-Tps}), there will
be a line break eventually after @code{ggg} in both input lines.
However, after processing the space after @code{ggg}, the partially
collected line is not overfull yet, so GNU @code{troff} continues to
collect input until it sees the space (or in this case, the newline)
after @code{hhh}.  At this point, the line is longer than the line
length, and the line gets broken.

In the first input line, since the @code{\R} escape leaves no traces,
the check for the overfull line hasn't been done yet at the point where
@code{\R} gets handled, and you get a value for the @code{.k} register
that is even greater than the current line length.

In the second input line, the insertion of @code{\h'0'} to emit an
invisible zero-width space forces GNU @code{troff} to check the line
length, which in turn causes the start of a new output line.  Now
@code{.k} returns the expected value.
@endDefreq

@code{nr} and @code{\R} each have two additional special forms to
increment or decrement a register.

@DefreqList {nr, ident @t{+}@Var{value}}
@DefreqItem {nr, ident @t{-}@Var{value}}
@DefescItemx {\\R, @code{'}, ident @t{+}value, @code{'}}
@DefescListEnd {\\R, @code{'}, ident @t{-}value, @code{'}}
Increment (decrement) register @var{ident} by @var{value}.

@Example
.nr a 1
.nr a +1
\na
    @result{} 2
@endExample

@cindex negating register values
A leading minus sign in @var{value} is always interpreted as a
decrementation operator, not an algebraic sign.  To assign a register a
negative value or the negated value of another register, you can use
either of two techniques to to force GNU @code{troff} to interpret the
assigned value as a numeric expression: enclose it in parentheses or
subtract it from zero.

@Example
.nr a 7
.nr b 3
.nr a -\nb
\na
    @result{} 4
.nr a (-\nb)
\na
    @result{} -3
.nr a 0-\nb
\na
    @result{} -3
@endExample

If a register's prior value does not exist (the register was undefined),
an increment or decrement is applied as if to@tie{}0.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {rr, ident}
@cindex removing a register (@code{rr})
@cindex register, removing (@code{rr})
Remove register @var{ident}.  If @var{ident} doesn't exist, the request
is ignored.  Technically, only the name is removed; the register's
contents are still accessible under aliases created with @code{aln}, if
any.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {rnn, ident1 ident2}
@cindex renaming a register (@code{rnn})
@cindex register, renaming (@code{rnn})
Rename register @var{ident1} to @var{ident2}.  If @var{ident1} doesn't
exist, the request is ignored.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {aln, new old}
@cindex alias, register, creation (@code{aln})
@cindex creating alias for register (@code{aln})
@cindex register, creating alias for (@code{aln})
Create an alias @var{new} for an existing register @var{old}, causing
the names to refer to the same stored object.  If @var{old} is
undefined, a warning in category @samp{reg} is produced and the request
is ignored.  @xref{Debugging}, for information about the enablement and

Registers can also be incremented or decremented by a configured amount

@cindex @code{\R}, difference to @code{nr}
Set register @var{ident} to @var{value} and its auto-incrementation
amount to to @var{incr}.  The @code{\R} escape doesn't support this
notation.
@endDefreq

Auto-incrementation is not @emph{completely} automatic; the @code{\n}
escape sequence in its basic form never alters the value of a register.
To apply auto-incrementation to a register, interpolate it with
@samp{\n}.

@DefescList {\\n, +, i, }
@DefescItem {\\n, -, i, }
@DefescItem {\\n, +(, id, }
@DefescItem {\\n, -(, id, }
@DefescItem {\\n, +[, ident, ]}
@DefescListEnd {\\n, -[, ident, ]}
Increment or decrement @var{ident} (one-character
name@tie{}@var{i}, two-character name @var{id}) by the register's
auto-incrementation value and then interpolate the new register value.
If @var{ident} has no auto-incrementation value, interpolate as with
@code{\n}.
@endDefesc

For example,

@Example
.nr a 0 1
.nr xx 0 5
.nr foo 0 -2
\n+a, \n+a, \n+a, \n+a, \n+a
.br
\n-(xx, \n-(xx, \n-(xx, \n-(xx, \n-(xx
.br
\n+[foo], \n+[foo], \n+[foo], \n+[foo], \n+[foo]
@endExample

produces

@Example
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
-5, -10, -15, -20, -25
-2, -4, -6, -8, -10
@endExample

@cindex increment value without changing the register
@cindex value, incrementing without changing the register
To change the increment value without changing the value of a register,
assign the register's value to itself by interpolating it, and specify
the desired increment normally.  Apply an increment of @samp{0} to
disable auto-incrementation of the register.

.nr a \na 10

@subsection Assigning Register Formats
@cindex assigning formats (@code{af})
@cindex formats, assigning (@code{af})

A writable register's value can be interpolated in several number
formats.  By default, conventional Arabic numerals are used.
Other formats see use in sectioning and outlining schemes and
alternative page numbering arrangements.

@Defreq {af, reg fmt}
Use number format @var{fmt} when interpolating register @var{reg}.
Valid number formats are as follows.

@table @code
@item 0@r{@dots{}}
Arabic numerals 0, 1, 2, and so on.
Any decimal digit is equivalent to @samp{0}; the formatter merely counts
the digits specified.  Multiple Arabic numerals in @var{fmt} cause
interpolations to be zero-padded on the left if necessary to at least as
many digits as specified (interpolations never truncate a register
value).  A register with format @samp{00} interpolates values 1, 2, 3 as
@samp{01}, @samp{02}, @samp{03}.  The default format for all writable
registers is @samp{0}.

@item I
@cindex Roman numerals
@cindex numerals, Roman
Uppercase Roman numerals: 0, I, II, III, IV,@tie{}@enddots{}

@item i
Lowercase Roman numerals: 0, i, ii, iii, iv,@tie{}@enddots{}

@item A
Uppercase letters: 0, A, B, C, @dots{},@tie{}Z, AA, AB,@tie{}@enddots{}

@item a
Lowercase letters: 0, a, b, c, @dots{},@tie{}z, aa, ab,@tie{}@enddots{}
@end table

Omitting @var{fmt} causes a warning in category @samp{missing}; see
@ref{Debugging}.  Specifying an unrecognized format is an error.

Zero values are interpolated as @samp{0} in non-Arabic formats.
Negative quantities are prefixed with @samp{-} irrespective of format.
In Arabic formats, the sign supplements the field width.  If @var{reg}
doesn't exist, it is created with a zero value.

@Example
.nr a 10
.af a 0           \" the default format
\na,
.af a I
\na,
.af a 321
.nr a (-\na)
\na,
.af a a
\na
    @result{} 10, X, -010, -j
@endExample

@cindex Roman numerals, extrema (maximum and minimum)
@cindex extreme values representable with Roman numerals
@cindex maximum value representable with Roman numerals
@cindex minimum value representable with Roman numerals
The representable extrema in the @samp{i} and @samp{I} formats
correspond to Arabic 39,999.  GNU @code{troff} uses @samp{w} and
@samp{z} to represent 5,000 and 10,000 in Roman numerals, respectively,
following the convention of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}---currently, the
correct glyphs for Roman numerals five thousand (@code{U+2181}) and ten
thousand (@code{U+2182}) are not used.

@cindex read-only register, changing format
@cindex changing format, and read-only registers
Assigning the format of a read-only register is an error.  Instead, copy
the read-only register's value to, and assign the format of, a writable
register.

@cindex register, format (@code{\g})
Interpolate the format of the register @var{reg} (one-character
name@tie{}@var{r}, two-character name @var{rg}).  Zeroes represent
Arabic formats.  If @var{reg} is not defined, @var{reg} is not created
and nothing is interpolated.  @code{\g} is interpreted even in copy mode
(@pxref{Copy Mode}).
@endDefesc

@cindex register format, in expressions
@cindex expressions, and register format
GNU @code{troff}'s input parser understands only Arabic numerals.  The
Roman numeral or alphabetic formats cannot be used as operands to
arithmetic operators in expressions (@pxref{Numeric Expressions}).  For
instance, it may be desirable to test the page number independently of
its format.

@Example
.af % i \" front matter

A break interrupts filling.  Various ways of causing breaks were shown

A break is implied by several other requests:@: @code{bp}, @code{ce},
@code{cf}, @code{fi}, @code{fl}, @code{in}, @code{nf}, @code{rj},
@code{sp}, @code{ti}, and @code{trf}.  If the no-break control character
is used with any of these requests, GNU @code{troff} suppresses the
break; instead the requested operation takes effect at the next break.
@samp{'br} does nothing.

@endExample

@noindent
@cindex pending output line
@cindex partially collected line
Output line properties like page offset, indentation, and adjustment are
not determined until the line has been broken.  An output line is said
to be @dfn{pending} if some input has been collected but an output line
corresponding to it has not yet been written; such an output line is
also termed @dfn{partially collected}.  If no output line is pending, it
is as if a break has already happened; additional breaks, whether
explicit or implicit, have no effect.

@Defreq {br, }
Break the line: emit any pending output line without adjustment.

@Example
foo bar
.br
baz
'br
qux
    @result{} foo bar
    @result{} baz qux
@endExample
@endDefreq

By default, GNU @code{troff} fills text and adjusts it to both margins.
Filling can be disabled via the @code{nf} request and re-enabled with

read-only register @code{.u} is set to@tie{}0.  The filling enablement
status is associated with the environment (@pxref{Environments}).  See
@ref{Line Continuation}, for interaction with the @code{\c} escape
sequence.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {ad, [@Var{mode}]}
@DefregListEndx {.j}
Enable output line adjustment in @var{mode}, taking effect when the
pending (or next) output line is broken.  Adjustment is suppressed when
filling is.  @var{mode} can have one of the following values.

@table @code
@item b
@itemx n
Adjust ``normally'': to both margins.  This is the GNU @code{troff}
default.

@item c
@cindex centered text (filled)
Center filled text.  Contrast with the @code{ce} request, which centers
text without filling it.

@item l
@cindex ragged-right text
Align text to the left margin, producing what is sometimes called
ragged-right text.

@item r
@cindex ragged-left text
Align text to the right margin, producing ragged-left text.
@end table

@var{mode} can also be a value previously stored in the @code{.j}
register.  Using @code{ad} without an argument is the same as @samp{.ad
\n[.j]}; unless filling is disabled, GNU @code{troff} resumes adjusting
lines in the same way it did before adjustment was disabled by
invocation of the @code{na} request.

@endExample

@cindex adjustment mode register (@code{.j})
The adjustment mode and enablement status are encoded in the read-only
register @code{.j}.  These parameters are associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).

The value of @code{.j} for any adjustment mode is an implementation
detail and should not be relied upon as a programmer's interface.  Do
not write logic to interpret or perform arithmetic on it.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {na, }
Disable output line adjustment.  This produces the same output as
alignment to the left margin, but the value of the adjustment mode
register @code{.j} is altered differently.  The adjustment mode and
enablement status are associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {brp, }
@DefescListEndx {\\p, , , }
Break, adjusting the line per the current adjustment mode.  @code{\p}
schedules a break with adjustment at the next word boundary.  The escape
sequence is itself neither a break nor a space of any kind; it can thus
be placed in the middle of a word to cause a break at the end of that
word.

Breaking with immediate adjustment can produce ugly results since GNU
@code{troff} doesn't have a sophisticated paragraph-building algorithm,
as @TeX{} has, for example.  Instead, GNU @code{troff} fills and adjusts
a paragraph line by line.

Center the next @var{nnn} input text lines without filling them.  A
pending output line is broken.  The count of lines remaining to be

associated with the environment (@pxref{Environments}).

@cindex @code{ce} request, difference from @w{@samp{.ad c}}
While the @w{@samp{.ad c}} request also centers text, it fills the text
as well.  The following example demonstrates the difference.

@Example
.de FR
This is a small text fragment that shows the differences
between the `.ce' and the `.ad c' requests.
..
.ll 4i
.ce 1000

    @result{}
    @result{} This is a small text fragment that shows
    @result{}  the differences between the @quoteleft{}.ce@quoteright{} and
    @result{}         the @quoteleft{}.ad c@quoteright{} requests.
@endExample

With no arguments, @code{ce} centers the next line of text.  @var{nnn}
specifies the number of lines to be centered.  If the argument is zero
or negative, centering is disabled.

The basis for centering text is the line length (as set with the
@code{ll} request) minus the indentation (as set with the @code{in}
request).  Temporary indentation is ignored.

The previous example illustrates a common idiom of turning centering on
for a quantity of lines far in excess of what is required, and off again
after the text to be centered.  This technique relieves humans of
counting lines for requests that take a count of input lines as an
argument.

@cindex space between sentences register (@code{.sss})
Set the sizes of spaces between words and
sentences.@footnote{@xref{Filling} and @ref{Sentences} for the
definitions of word and sentence boundaries, respectively.}  Their units
are twelfths of the space width of the current font.  Initially both the
@var{word-space-size} and @var{additional-sentence-space-size}
are@tie{}12.  Negative values are not permitted.  The request is ignored
if there are no arguments.

@cindex inter-word spacing, minimal
@cindex minimal inter-word spacing
@cindex space, between words
The first argument, the inter-word space size, is a minimum; if an
output line undergoes adjustment, such spaces may increase in width.

@cindex inter-sentence space, additional
@cindex additional inter-sentence space
@cindex space, between sentences
The optional second argument sets the amount of additional space
separating sentences on the same output line.  If omitted, this amount
is set to @var{word-space-size}.

The read-only registers @code{.ss} and @code{.sss} hold the values of
minimal inter-word space and additional inter-sentence space,
respectively.  These parameters are associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}), and rounded down to the nearest multiple
of@tie{}12 on terminal output devices.

@cindex filling, and inter-sentence space
@cindex mode, fill, and inter-sentence space
Additional inter-sentence space is used only if the output line is not
full when the end of a sentence occurs in the input.  If a sentence ends
at the end of an input line, then both an inter-word space and an
inter-sentence space are added to the output; if two spaces follow the
end of a sentence in the middle of an input line, then the second space
becomes an inter-sentence space in the output.  Additional
inter-sentence space is not adjusted, but the inter-word space that
always precedes it may be.  Further input spaces after the second, if
present, are adjusted as normal.

@cindex discardable horizontal space
@cindex space, discardable, horizontal
@cindex horizontal discardable space
A related application of the @code{ss} request is to insert discardable
horizontal space; i.e., space that is discarded at a line break.  For
example, some footnote styles collect the notes into a single paragraph
with large spaces between each.

@cindex hyphenation, automatic
@cindex automatic hyphenation
When filling, GNU @code{troff} hyphenates words as needed at
user-specified and automatically determined hyphenation points.  The
machine-driven determination of hyphenation points in words requires
algorithms and data, and is susceptible to conventions and preferences.
Before tackling such @dfn{automatic hyphenation}, let us consider how
hyphenation points can be set manually.

@cindex hyphenation, explicit
@cindex explicit hyphenation
@cindex hyphenation, manual
@cindex manual hyphenation
Explicitly hyphenated words such as ``mother-in-law'' are always
eligible for breaking after each of their hyphens.  Relatively few words
in a language offer such obvious break points, however, and automatic
hyphenation is not perfect, particularly for unusual words found in
technical literature.  We may wish to instruct GNU @code{troff} how to
hyphenate specific words if the need arises.

@cindex hyphenation exceptions
@Defreq {hw, word @dots{}}
Define each @dfn{hyphenation exception} @var{word} with each hyphen `-'
in the word indicating a hyphenation point.  For example, the request

@Example
.hw in-sa-lub-rious alpha
@endExample

@c Serendipitously, in PDF output, the "alpha" below gets hyphenated.
@c Try to preserve this felicity in future edits.
marks potential hyphenation points in ``insalubrious'', and prevents
``alpha'' from being hyphenated at all.

Besides the space character, any character whose hyphenation code is
zero can be used to separate the arguments of @code{hw} (see the
@code{hcode} request below).  In addition, this request can be used more
than once.

@cindex @code{hw} request, and @code{hy} restrictions
Hyphenation points specified with @code{hw} are not subject to the
within-word placement restrictions imposed by the @code{hy} request (see
below).

Hyphenation exceptions specified with the @code{hw} request are
associated with the hyphenation language (see the @code{hla} request
below) and environment (@pxref{Environments}); calling the @code{hw}
request in the absence of a hyphenation language is an error.

The request is ignored if there are no parameters.
@endDefreq

These are known as hyphenation @emph{exceptions} in the expectation that
most users will avail themselves of automatic hyphenation; these
exceptions override any rules that would normally apply to a word
matching a hyphenation exception defined with @code{hw}.

Situations also arise when only a specific occurrence of a word needs
its hyphenation altered or suppressed, or when something that is not a
word in a natural language, like a URL, needs to be breakable in
sensible places without hyphens.

@cindex hyphenation, disabling (@code{\%})
To tell GNU @code{troff} how to hyphenate words as they occur in input,
use the @code{\%} escape, also known as the @dfn{hyphenation character}.
Each instance within a word indicates to GNU @code{troff} that the
word may be hyphenated at that point, while prefixing a word with this
escape prevents it from being otherwise hyphenated.  This mechanism
affects only that occurrence of the word; to change the hyphenation of a
word for the remainder of input processing, use the @code{hw} request.

@cindex @code{\X}, followed by @code{\%}
@cindex @code{\Y}, followed by @code{\%}
@cindex @code{\%}, following @code{\X} or @code{\Y}
GNU @code{troff} regards the escape sequences @code{\X} and @code{\Y} as
starting a word; that is, the @code{\%} escape sequence in, say,
@w{@samp{\X'...'\%foobar}} or @w{@samp{\Y'...'\%foobar}} no longer
prevents hyphenation of @samp{foobar} but inserts a hyphenation point
just prior to it; most likely this isn't what you want.

@cindex file names, breaking (@code{\:})
@cindex breaking file names (@code{\:})

@cindex breaking URLs (@code{\:})
@code{\:} inserts a non-printing break point; that is, a word can break
there, but the soft hyphen glyph (see below) is not written to the
output if it does.  This escape sequence is an input word boundary, so
the remainder of the word is subject to hyphenation as normal.

You can use @code{\:} and @code{\%} in combination to control breaking
of a file name or URL or to permit hyphenation only after certain
explicit hyphens within a word.

@endDefesc

@Defreq {hc, [@Var{char}]}
Change the hyphenation character to @var{char}.  This character then
works as the @code{\%} escape sequence normally does, and thus no longer
appears in the output.@footnote{@code{\%} itself stops marking
hyphenation points but still produces no output glyph.}  Without an
argument, @code{hc} resets the hyphenation character to @code{\%} (the
default).  The hyphenation character is associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).

when a word is hyphenated automatically or at a hyphenation character,
to@tie{}@var{glyph}.@footnote{``Soft'' because it appears in output only
where a hyphenation break is performed; a ``hard'' hyphen, as in
``long-term'', always appears.}  If the argument is omitted, the soft
hyphen glyph is set to the default, @code{\[hy]}.  If the selected glyph
does not exist in the font in use at a potential hyphenation point, then
the line is not broken at that point.  Neither character definitions
(specified with the @code{char} and similar requests) nor translations
(specified with the @code{tr} request) are considered when assigning the
soft hyphen glyph.
@endDefreq

@cindex hyphenation parameters, automatic
@cindex automatic hyphenation parameters
Several requests influence automatic hyphenation.  Because conventions
vary, a variety of hyphenation modes is available to the @code{hy}
request; these determine whether hyphenation will apply to a
word prior to breaking a line at the end of a page (more or less; see
below for details), and at which positions within that word
automatically determined hyphenation points are permissible.  The places
within a word that are eligible for hyphenation are determined by
language-specific data and lettercase relationships.  Furthermore,
hyphenation of a word might be suppressed because too many previous
lines have been hyphenated (@code{hlm}), the line has not reached a
certain minimum length (@code{hym}), or the line can instead be adjusted
with up to a certain amount of additional inter-word space (@code{hys}).

@cindex hyphenation mode register (@code{.hy})
@DefreqList {hy, [@Var{mode}]}
@DefregListEndx {.hy}
Set automatic hyphenation mode to @var{mode}, an integer encoding
conditions for hyphenation; if omitted, @samp{1} is implied.  The
hyphenation mode is available in the read-only register @samp{.hy}; it
is associated with the environment (@pxref{Environments}).  The default
hyphenation mode depends on the localization package loaded when GNU
@code{troff} starts up; see the @code{hpf} request below.

Typesetting practice generally does not avail itself of every
opportunity for hyphenation, but the details differ by language and site
mandates.  The hyphenation modes of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} were
implemented with English-language publishing practices of the 1970s in
mind, not a scrupulous enumeration of conceivable parameters.  GNU
@code{troff} extends those modes such that finer-grained control is
possible, favoring compatibility with older implementations over a more
intuitive arrangement.  The means of hyphenation mode control is a set
of numbers that can be added up to encode the behavior
sought.@footnote{The mode is a vector of Booleans encoded as an integer.
To a programmer, this fact is easily deduced from the exclusive use of
powers of two for the configuration parameters; they are computationally
easy to ``mask off'' and compare to zero.  To almost everyone else, the
arrangement seems recondite and unfriendly.}  The entries in the
following table are termed @dfn{values}; the sum of the desired
values is the @dfn{mode}.

@table @code
@item 0
disables hyphenation.

@item 1
enables hyphenation except after the first and before the last character
of a word.
@end table

The remaining values ``imply'' 1; that is, they enable hyphenation
under the same conditions as @samp{.hy 1}, and then apply or lift
restrictions relative to that basis.

@table @code
@item 2
disables hyphenation of the last word on a page,@footnote{Hyphenation is
prevented if the next page location trap is closer to the vertical
drawing position than the next text baseline would be.  GNU @code{troff}
automatically inserts an implicit vertical position trap at the end of
each page to cause a page transition.  Users or macro packages can set
such traps explicitly to prevent hyphenation of the last word in a
column in multi-column page layouts or before floating figures or
tables.  @xref{Page Location Traps}.} even for manually hyphenated
words.

@item 4
disables hyphenation before the last two characters of a word.

@item 8
disables hyphenation after the first two characters of a word.

@item 16
enables hyphenation before the last character of a word.

@item 32
enables hyphenation after the first character of a word.
@end table

Apart from value@tie{}2, restrictions imposed by the hyphenation mode
are @emph{not} respected for words whose hyphenations have been
explicitly specified with the hyphenation character (@samp{\%} by
default) or the @code{hw} request.

The nonzero values in the previous table are additive.  For example,
value@tie{}12 causes GNU @code{troff} to hyphenate neither the last two
nor the first two characters of a word.  Some values cannot be used
together because they contradict; for instance, values 4 and@tie{}16,
and values 8 and@tie{}32.  As noted, it is superfluous to add 1 to any
nonzero even mode.

@cindex hyphenation pattern files
@cindex pattern files, for hyphenation
The automatic placement of hyphens in words is determined by
@dfn{pattern files}, which are derived from @TeX{} and available for
several languages.  The number of characters at the beginning of a word
after which the first hyphenation point should be inserted is determined
by the patterns themselves; it can't be reduced further without
introducing additional, invalid hyphenation points (unfortunately, this
information is not part of a pattern file---you have to know it in
advance).  The same is true for the number of characters at the end of
a word before the last hyphenation point should be inserted.  For
example, you can supply the following input to @samp{echo $(nroff)}.

@Example
.ll 1
.hy 48
splitting
@endExample

@noindent
You will get

@Example
s- plit- t- in- g
@endExample

@noindent
instead of the correct `split- ting'.  English patterns as distributed
with GNU @code{troff} need two characters at the beginning and three
characters at the end; this means that value@tie{}4 of @code{hy} is
mandatory.  Value@tie{}8 is possible as an additional restriction, but
values@tie{}16 and@tie{}32 should be avoided, as should mode@tie{}1.
Modes@tie{}4 and@tie{}6 are typical.

A table of left and right minimum character counts for hyphenation as
needed by the patterns distributed with GNU @code{troff} follows; see
the @cite{groff_tmac@r{(5)}} man page for more information on GNU
@code{troff}'s language macro files.

@cindex patterns for hyphenation (@code{hpf})
Read hyphenation patterns from @var{pattern-file}, which is sought
in the same way that macro files are with the @code{mso} request or the
@option{-m@var{name}} command-line option to @code{groff}.  The
@var{pattern-file} should have the same format as (simple) @TeX{}
pattern files.  More specifically, the following scanning rules are
implemented.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A percent sign starts a comment (up to the end of the line) even if
preceded by a backslash.

@item
``Digraphs'' like @code{\$} are not supported.

@item
@code{^^@var{xx}} (where each @var{x} is 0--9 or a--f) and
@code{^^@var{c}} (character @var{c} in the code point range 0--127
decimal) are recognized; other uses of @code{^} cause an error.

@item
No macro expansion is performed.

@item
@code{hpf} checks for the expression @code{\patterns@{@dots{}@}}
(possibly with whitespace before or after the braces).  Everything
between the braces is taken as hyphenation patterns.  Consequently,
@code{@{} and @code{@}} are not allowed in patterns.

@item
Similarly, @code{\hyphenation@{@dots{}@}} gives a list of hyphenation
exceptions.

@item
@code{\endinput} is recognized also.

@item
For backward compatibility, if @code{\patterns} is missing, the whole
file is treated as a list of hyphenation patterns (except that the
@code{%} character is recognized as the start of a comment).
@end itemize

The @code{hpfa} request appends a file of patterns to the current list.

The @code{hpfcode} request defines mapping values for character codes in
pattern files.  It is an older mechanism no longer used by GNU
@code{troff}'s own macro files; for its successor, see @code{hcode}
below.  @code{hpf} or @code{hpfa} apply the mapping after reading the
patterns but before replacing or appending to the active list of
patterns.  Its arguments are pairs of character codes---integers from 0
to@tie{}255.  The request maps character code@tie{}@var{a} to
code@tie{}@var{b}, code@tie{}@var{c} to code@tie{}@var{d}, and so on.
Character codes that would otherwise be invalid in GNU @code{troff} can
be used.  By default, every code maps to itself except those for letters
`A' to `Z', which map to those for `a' to `z'.

The set of hyphenation patterns is associated with the language set by
the @code{hla} request (see below).  The @code{hpf} request is usually
invoked by a localization file loaded by the @file{troffrc} file.  By
default, @file{troffrc} loads the localization file for
English.@footnote{As of @code{groff} 1.23.0, localization files for
Czech (@code{cs}), German (@code{de}), English (@code{en}), French
(@code{fr}), Italian (@code{it}), Japanese (@code{ja}), Swedish
(@code{sv}), and Chinese (@code{zh}) exist.}  For Western languages, the
localization file sets the hyphenation mode and loads hyphenation
patterns and exceptions.

A second call to @code{hpf} (for the same language) replaces the
hyphenation patterns with the new ones.  Invoking @code{hpf} or
@code{hpfa} causes an error if there is no hyphenation language.  If no
@code{hpf} request is specified (either in the document, in a file
loaded at startup, or in a macro package), GNU @code{troff} won't
automatically hyphenate at all.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {hcode, c1 code1 [c2 code2] @dots{}}
@cindex hyphenation code (@code{hcode})
@cindex code, hyphenation (@code{hcode})
Set the hyphenation code of character @var{c1} to @var{code1}, that of
@var{c2} to @var{code2}, and so on.  A hyphenation code must be an
ordinary character (not a special character escape sequence) other than
a digit or a space.  The request is ignored if given no arguments.

For hyphenation to work, hyphenation codes must be set up.  At
startup, GNU @code{troff} assigns hyphenation codes to the letters
@samp{a}--@samp{z} (mapped to themselves), to the letters
@samp{A}--@samp{Z} (mapped to @samp{a}--@samp{z}), and zero to all other
characters.  Normally, hyphenation patterns contain only lowercase
letters which should be applied regardless of case.  In other words,
they assume that the words `FOO' and `Foo' should be hyphenated exactly
as `foo' is.  The @code{hcode} request extends this principle to letters
outside the Unicode basic Latin alphabet; without it, words containing
such letters won't be hyphenated properly even if the corresponding
hyphenation patterns contain them.

For example, the following @code{hcode} requests are necessary to assign
hyphenation codes to the letters @samp{}, needed for German.

@Example
.hcode     
.hcode     
.hcode     
.hcode  
@endExample

Without these assignments, GNU @code{troff} treats the German word
@w{`Kindergrten'} (the plural form of `kindergarten') as two words
@w{`kinderg'} and @w{`rten'} because the hyphenation code of the
umlaut@tie{}a is zero by default, just like a space.  There is a German
hyphenation pattern that covers @w{`kinder'}, so GNU @code{troff} finds
the hyphenation `kin-der'.  The other two hyphenation points
(`kin-der-gr-ten') are missed.

inserted below the current line.  A negative number adds space above.
If this escape is used multiple times on the same line, the maximum of

@cindex @acronym{EBCDIC} encoding of a tab
A tab character (@acronym{ASCII} char@tie{}9, @acronym{EBCDIC}
char@tie{}5) causes a horizontal movement to the next tab stop (much

 @Var{r2} @dots{} @Var{rn}]}
@DefregListEndx {.tabs}
Change tab stop positions.  This request takes a series of tab
specifiers as arguments (optionally divided into two groups with the
letter @samp{T}) that indicate where each tab stop is to be, overriding
any previous settings.  Calling @code{ta} without an argument removes
all tab stops.

Tab stops can be specified absolutely, i.e., as distances from the left
margin.  For example, the following sets 6@tie{}tab stops every one
inch.

@Example
.ta 1i 2i 3i 4i 5i 6i
@endExample

Tab stops can also be specified using a leading @samp{+}, which means
that the specified tab stop is set relative to the previous tab stop.
For example, the following is equivalent to the previous example.

@Example
.ta 1i +1i +1i +1i +1i +1i
@endExample

@code{groff} supports an extended syntax to specify repeating tab stops
after the @samp{T} mark.  These values are always taken as relative
distances from the previous tab stop.  This is the idiomatic way to
specify tab stops at equal intervals in @code{groff}.  The following is,
yet again, the same as the previous examples.  It does more, in fact,
since it defines an infinite number of tab stops at one-inch intervals.

@Example
.ta T 1i
@endExample

Now we are ready to interpret the full syntax given above.  The
@code{ta} request sets tabs at positions @var{n1}, @var{n2}, @dots{},
@var{nn}, then at @var{nn}+@var{r1}, @var{nn}+@var{r2}, @dots{},
@var{nn}+@var{rn}, then at @var{nn}+@var{rn}+@var{r1},
@var{nn}+@var{rn}+@var{r2}, @dots{}, @var{nn}+@var{rn}+@var{rn}, and so
on.

For example, @samp{4c +6c T 3c 5c 2c} is equivalent to @samp{4c 10c 13c
18c 20c 23c 28c 30c @dots{}}.

Text written to a tab column (i.e., between two tab stops, or between a
tab stop and an output line boundary) may be aligned to the right or
left, or centered in the column.  This is specified by appending
@samp{R}, @samp{L}, or @samp{C} to the tab specifier.  The default
justification is @samp{L}.

@Example
.ta 1i 2iC 3iR
@endExample

Some notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The default unit of the @code{ta} request is @samp{m}.

@item
A tab stop is converted into a non-breakable horizontal movement that
cannot be adjusted.  For example,

@Example
.ds foo a\tb\tc
.ta T 5i
\*[foo]
@endExample

@noindent
creates a single line, which is a bit longer than 10@tie{}inches (a
string is used to show exactly where the tab characters are).  Now
consider the following:

@Example
.ds bar a\tb b\tc
.ta T 5i
\*[bar]
@endExample

@noindent
@code{gtroff} first converts the tab stops of the line into unbreakable
horizontal movements, then splits the line after the second @samp{b}
(assuming a sufficiently short line length).  Usually, this isn't what
the user wants.

@item
Superfluous tabs (i.e., tab characters that do not correspond to a tab
stop) are ignored except the first one, which delimits the characters
belonging to the last tab stop for right-justifying or centering.
Consider the following example

@Example
.ds Z   foo\tbar\tfoo
.ds ZZ  foo\tbar\tfoobar
.ds ZZZ foo\tbar\tfoo\tbar
.ta 2i 4iR
\*[Z]
.br
\*[ZZ]
.br
\*[ZZZ]
.br
@endExample

@noindent
which produces the following output:

@Example
foo                 bar              foo
foo                 bar           foobar
foo                 bar              foobar
@endExample

@noindent
The first line right-justifies the second `foo' relative to the tab
stop.  The second line right-justifies `foobar'.  The third line finally
right-justifies only `foo' because of the additional tab character,
which marks the end of the string belonging to the last defined tab
stop.

@subsection Leaders
@cindex leaders

Sometimes it may be desirable to use the @code{tc} request to fill a
particular tab stop with a given glyph (for example dots in a table of
contents), but also normal tab stops on the rest of the line.
For this GNU @code{troff} provides an alternate tab mechanism, called
@dfn{leaders}, which does just that.@footnote{This is pronounced to
rhyme with ``feeder'', and refers to how the glyphs ``lead'' the eye
across the page to the corresponding page number or other datum.}

@cindex leader character
A leader character (character code@tie{}1) behaves similarly to a tab
character: It moves to the next tab stop.  The only difference is that
for this movement, the fill glyph defaults to a period character and not
to space.

@Defesc {\\a, , , }

@endDefesc

@Defreq {lc, [@Var{fill-glyph}]}
@cindex leader repetition character (@code{lc})
@cindex character, leader repetition (@code{lc})

When writing a leader, GNU @code{troff} fills the space to the next tab
stop with dots @samp{.}.  A different @dfn{leader repetition character}
can be specified with the @code{lc} request, causing GNU @code{troff} to
write as many instances of @var{fill-glyph} as are necessary to occupy
the interval from the current horizontal location to the next tab stop.
With no argument, GNU @code{troff} treats leaders the same as tabs.  The
leader repetition character is associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).@footnote{Leader repetition @emph{character} is a
misnomer since it is an output glyph.}  Only a single @var{fill-glyph}

@cindex table of contents
@cindex contents, table of
For a table of contents, to name an example, tab stops may be defined so

number slightly separated from the dots.

@Example
.ds entry 1.1\tFoo\a\t12
.lc .
.ta 1i 5i +.25i

@dfn{Fields} are a more general way of laying out tabular data.  A field
is defined as the data between a pair of @dfn{delimiting characters}.
It contains substrings that are separated by @dfn{padding characters}.
The width of a field is the distance on the @emph{input} line from the
position where the field starts to the next tab stop.  A padding
character inserts an adjustable space similar to @TeX{}'s @code{\hss}
command (thus it can even be negative) to make the sum of all substring
lengths plus the adjustable space equal to the field width.  If more
than one padding character is inserted, the available space is evenly
distributed among them.

@Defreq {fc, [@Var{delim-char} [@Var{padding-char}]]}
Define a delimiting and a padding character for fields.  If the latter
is missing, the padding character defaults to a space character.  If
there is no argument at all, the field mechanism is disabled (which is
the default).  In contrast to, e.g., the tab repetition character,
delimiting and padding characters are @emph{not} associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).

This request can be very helpful in writing macros since it is not

@Example

.\" .BR request from the man macro package
.eo
.de BR
.  ds result \&
.  while (\n[.$] >= 2) \@{\

Set the escape character to@tie{}@var{c}.  With no argument the default
escape character @samp{\} is restored.  It can be also used to re-enable
the escape mechanism after an @code{eo} request.

Changing the escape character globally likely breaks macro packages,
since GNU @code{troff} has no mechanism to `intern' macros, i.e., to
convert a macro definition into an internal form that is independent of
its representation (@TeX{} has such a mechanism).  If a macro is called,
it is executed literally.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {ecs, }
@DefreqListEndx {ecr, }
The @code{ecs} request saves the current escape character.  Use this
request in combination with the @code{ec} request to temporarily change
the escape character.

The @code{ecr} request restores the escape character saved with
@code{ecs}, or sets the escape character to @samp{\} if none has been
saved.
@endDefreq

@Defesc {\\e, , , }
Interpolate the current escape character, which is the backslash
@samp{\} by default.
@endDefesc

A @dfn{translation} is a mapping of an input character to an output
glyph.  The mapping occurs at output time, i.e., the input character
gets assigned the metric information of the mapped output character
right before input tokens are converted to nodes (@pxref{Gtroff
Internals}, for more on this process).

@DefreqList {tr, @Var{a}@Var{b}@Var{c}@Var{d}@dots{}}
@DefreqListEndx {trin, @Var{a}@Var{b}@Var{c}@Var{d}@dots{}}
Translate character @var{a} to glyph@tie{}@var{b}, character @var{c} to
glyph@tie{}@var{d}, and so on.  If there is an odd number of characters
in the argument, the last one is translated to a fixed-width space (the
same one obtained by the @w{@samp{\ }} escape).

The @code{trin} request is identical to @code{tr}, but when you unformat
a diversion with @code{asciify} it ignores the translation.

@item
@cindex @code{\&}, and translations
The pair @samp{@var{c}\&} (this is an arbitrary character@tie{}@var{c}
followed by the non-printing input break) maps this character to
nothing.

@Example
.tr a\&
foo bar
    @result{} foo br
@endExample

@noindent
It is even possible to map the space character to nothing:

@Example
.tr aa \&
foo bar
    @result{} foobar
@endExample

@noindent
As shown in the example, the space character can't be the first
character/glyph pair as an argument of @code{tr}.  Additionally, it is
not possible to map the space character to any other glyph; requests
like @w{@samp{.tr aa x}} undo @w{@samp{.tr aa \&}} instead.

If justification is active, lines are justified in spite of the `empty'
space character (but there is no minimal distance, i.e., the space
character, between words).

@item
After an output glyph has been constructed (this happens at the moment
immediately before the glyph is appended to an output glyph list, either
by direct output, in a macro, diversion, or string), it is no longer
affected by @code{tr}.

@item
Translating character to glyphs where one of them or both are undefined
is possible also; @code{tr} does not check whether the entities in its
argument do exist.

@xref{Gtroff Internals}.

@item
@code{troff} no longer has a hard-coded dependency on @w{Latin-1}; all
@code{char@var{XXX}} entities have been removed from the font
description files.  This has a notable consequence that shows up in
warnings like @samp{can't find character with input code @var{XXX}} if
the @code{tr} request isn't handled properly.

Consider the following translation:

@Example
.tr 
@endExample

@noindent
This maps input character @code{} onto glyph @code{}, which is
identical to glyph @code{char201}.  But this glyph intentionally doesn't
exist!  Instead, @code{\[char201]} is treated as an input character
entity and is by default mapped onto @code{\['E]}, and @code{gtroff}
doesn't handle translations of translations.

The right way to write the above translation is

@Example
.tr \['E]
@endExample

@noindent
In other words, the first argument of @code{tr} should be an input
character or entity, and the second one a glyph entity.

@item
Without an argument, the @code{tr} request is ignored.

Historically, @code{nroff} and @code{troff} were two separate programs;
the former for terminal output, the latter for typesetters.  GNU
@code{troff} merges both functions into one executable@footnote{A
GNU @command{nroff} program is available for convenience; it calls GNU
@code{troff} to perform the formatting.} that sends its output to a
device driver (@code{grotty} for terminal devices, @code{grops} for
PostScript, and so on) which interprets this intermediate output format.
When discussing @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, it makes sense to talk
about @dfn{@code{nroff} mode} and @dfn{@code{troff} mode} since the
differences are hard-coded.  GNU @code{troff} takes information from
device and font description files without handling requests specially if
a terminal output device is used, so such a strong distinction is
unnecessary.

Usually, a macro package can be used with all output devices.
Nevertheless, it is sometimes necessary to make a distinction between
terminal and non-terminal devices: GNU @code{troff} provides two
built-in conditions @samp{n} and @samp{t} for the @code{if}, @code{ie},
and @code{while} requests to decide whether GNU @code{troff} shall
behave like @code{nroff} or like @code{troff}.

@Defreq {troff, }

Make the @samp{t} built-in condition true (and the @samp{n} built-in
condition false) for @code{if}, @code{ie}, and @code{while} conditional
requests.  This is the default if GNU @code{troff} (@emph{not}
@code{groff}) is started with the @option{-R} switch to avoid loading of
the startup files @file{troffrc} and @file{troffrc-end}.  Without
@option{-R}, GNU @code{troff} stays in @code{troff} mode if the output
device is not a terminal (e.g., `ps').

@pindex tty.tmac
Set page offset to @var{offset} (or increment or decrement its current
value by @var{offset}).  If invoked without an argument, the page offset
is restored to the value before the previous @code{po} request.
This request does not cause a break; the page offset in effect when an
output line is broken prevails (@pxref{Manipulating Filling and
Adjustment}).  The initial value is 1@dmn{i} and the default scaling
unit is @samp{m}.  On terminal devices, the page offset is set to zero
by a driver-specific macro file, @file{tty.tmac}.  The current page
offset can be found in the read-only register @samp{.o}.

@DefreqList {in, [@Var{indent}]}
@DefreqItem {in, @t{+}@Var{indent}}
@DefreqItem {in, @t{-}@Var{indent}}
@DefregListEndx {.i}
Set indentation to @var{indent} (or increment or decrement the current
value by @var{indent}).  This request causes a break.  Initially, there
is no indentation.

If @code{in} is called without an argument, the indentation is reset to
the previous value before the last call to @code{in}.  The default
scaling indicator is @samp{m}.

If a negative indentation value is specified (which is not allowed),
@code{gtroff} emits a warning in category @samp{range} and sets the
indentation to zero.

The effect of @code{in} is delayed until a partially collected line (if
it exists) is output.  A temporary indentation value is reset to zero
also.

The current indentation (as set by @code{in}) can be found in the
read-only register @samp{.i}.  The indentation is associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {ti, offset}
@DefreqItem {ti, @t{+}@Var{offset}}
@DefreqItem {ti, @t{-}@Var{offset}}
@DefregListEndx {.in}
Temporarily indent the next output line by @var{offset}.  If an
increment or decrement value is specified, adjust the temporary
indentation relative to the value set by the @code{in} request.

This request causes a break; its value is associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).  The default scaling indicator is
@samp{m}.  A call of @code{ti} without an argument is ignored.

If the total indentation value is negative (which is not allowed),
@code{gtroff} emits a warning in category @samp{range} and sets the
temporary indentation to zero.  `Total indentation' is either
@var{offset} if specified as an absolute value, or the temporary plus
normal indentation, if @var{offset} is given as a relative value.

The effect of @code{ti} is delayed until a partially collected line (if
it exists) is output.

The read-only register @code{.in} is the indentation that applies to the
current output line.

The difference between @code{.i} and @code{.in} is that the latter takes
into account whether a partially collected line still uses the old
indentation value or a temporary indentation value is active.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {ll, [@Var{length}]}
@DefreqItem {ll, @t{+}@Var{length}}
@DefreqItem {ll, @t{-}@Var{length}}
@DefregItemx {.l}
@DefregListEndx {.ll}
Set the line length to @var{length} (or increment or decrement the
current value by @var{length}).  Initially, the line length is set to
6.5@dmn{i}.  The effect of @code{ll} is delayed until a partially
collected line (if it exists) is output.  The default scaling indicator
is @samp{m}.

If @code{ll} is called without an argument, the line length is reset to
the previous value before the last call to @code{ll}.  If a negative
line length is specified (which is not allowed), @code{gtroff} emits a
warning in category @samp{range} and sets the line length to zero.  The
line length is associated with the environment (@pxref{Environments}).

@cindex line length register (@code{.l})
The current line length (as set by @code{ll}) can be found in the
read-only register @samp{.l}.  The read-only register @code{.ll} is the
line length that applies to the current output line.

Similar to @code{.i} and @code{.in}, the difference between @code{.l}
and @code{.ll} is that the latter takes into account whether a partially
collected line still uses the old line length value.

@cindex input line continuation (@code{\@key{RET}})
@cindex line, input, continuation (@code{\@key{RET}})
@cindex continuation, input line (@code{\@key{RET}})
@code{\@key{RET}} (a backslash immediately followed by a newline)
suppresses the effects of that newline in the input.  The next input
line thus retains the classification of its predecessor as a control or
text line.  @code{\@key{RET}} is useful for managing line lengths in the
input during document maintenance; you can break an input line in the
middle of a request invocation, macro call, or escape sequence.  Input
line continuation is invisible to the formatter, with two exceptions:
the @code{|} operator recognizes the new input line
(@pxref{Numeric Expressions}), and the input line counter register
@code{.c} is incremented.

@c Wrap example at 56 columns (on the _output_).  We use 50n in the
@c groff input to avoid line adjustment.

GNU @code{troff} provides some primitive operations for controlling page
layout.

@DefreqList {pl, [@Var{length}]}
@DefreqItem {pl, @t{+}@Var{length}}
@DefreqItem {pl, @t{-}@Var{length}}
@DefregListEndx {.p}
@cindex page length (@code{pl})
@cindex length of page (@code{pl})
Set the @dfn{page length} to @var{length} (or increment or decrement the
current value by @var{length}).  This is the length of the physical
output page.  The default scaling indicator is @samp{v}.

@cindex page length register (@code{.p})
The current setting can be found in the read-only register @samp{.p}.

@cindex top margin
@cindex margin, top
@cindex bottom margin
@cindex margin, bottom
This specifies only the size of the page, not the top and bottom
margins.  Those are not set by GNU @code{troff} directly.  @xref{Traps},
for further information on how to do this.

Negative @code{pl} values are possible also, but not very useful: no
trap is sprung, and each line is output on a single page (thus
suppressing all vertical spacing).

If no argument or an invalid argument is given, @code{pl} sets the page
length to 11@dmn{i}.
@endDefreq

@cindex headers
@cindex footers
@cindex titles
GNU @code{troff} provides several operations that help in setting up top
and bottom titles (also known as headers and footers).

@Defreq {tl, @code{'}@Var{left}@code{'}@Var{center}@code{'}@Var{right}@code{'}}
@cindex title line (@code{tl})
@cindex three-part title (@code{tl})
@cindex page number character (@code{%})
Print a @dfn{title line}.  It consists of three parts: a left-justified
portion, a centered portion, and a right-justified portion.  The
argument separator @samp{'} can be replaced with any character not
occurring in the title line.  The @samp{%} character is replaced with
the current page number.  This character can be changed with the
@code{pc} request (see below).

Without argument, @code{tl} is ignored.

Some notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The line length set by the @code{ll} request is not honoured by
@code{tl}; use the @code{lt} request (described below) instead, to
control line length for text set by @code{tl}.

@item
A title line is not restricted to the top or bottom of a page.

@item
@code{tl} prints the title line immediately, ignoring a partially
collected line (which stays untouched).

@item
It is not an error to omit closing delimiters.  For example,
@w{@samp{.tl /foo}} is equivalent to @w{@samp{.tl /foo///}}: It prints a
title line with the left-justified word @samp{foo}; the centered and
right-justified parts are empty.

@item
@code{tl} accepts the same parameter delimiting characters as the
@code{\A} escape sequence; see @ref{Escape Sequences}.
@end itemize
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {lt, [@Var{length}]}

@DefregListEndx {.lt}
@cindex length of title line (@code{lt})
@cindex title line, length (@code{lt})
@cindex title line length register (@code{.lt})
The title line is printed using its own line length, which is specified
(or incremented or decremented) with the @code{lt} request.  Initially,
the title line length is set to 6.5@dmn{i}.  If a negative line length
is specified (which is not allowed), @code{gtroff} emits a warning in
category @samp{range} and sets the title line length to zero.  The
default scaling indicator is @samp{m}.  If @code{lt} is called without
an argument, the title length is reset to the previous value before the
last call to @code{lt}.  The current setting is available in the
@code{.lt} read-only register; it is associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).

Change (increase or decrease) the page number of the @emph{next} page.
The only argument is the page number; the request is ignored without a

The read-only register @code{.pn} contains the number of the next page:
either the value set by a @code{pn} request, or the number of the
current page plus@tie{}1.

@cindex page break, conditional (@code{ne})
It is often necessary to force a certain amount of space before a new
page occurs.  This is most useful to make sure that there is not a
single @dfn{orphan} line left at the bottom of a page.  The @code{ne}
request ensures that there is a certain distance, specified by the first
argument, before the next page is triggered (@pxref{Traps}).  The
default scaling indicator for @code{ne} is @samp{v}; the default value
of @var{space} is@tie{}1@dmn{v} if no argument is given.

For example, to make sure that no fewer than 2@tie{}lines get orphaned,
do the following before each paragraph:

@Example
.ne 2
text text text
@endExample

@code{ne} then automatically causes a page break if there is space for
one line only.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {sv, [@Var{space}]}
@DefreqListEndx {os, }
@cindex @code{ne} request, comparison with @code{sv}
@code{sv} is similar to the @code{ne} request; it reserves the specified
amount of vertical space.  If the desired amount of space exists before
the next trap (or the bottom page boundary if no trap is set), the space
is output immediately (ignoring a partially collected line, which stays
untouched).  If there is not enough space, it is stored for later output
via the @code{os} request.  The default value is@tie{}1@dmn{v} if no
argument is given; the default scaling indicator is @samp{v}.

@cindex @code{sv} request, and no-space mode
@cindex @code{os} request, and no-space mode
Both @code{sv} and @code{os} ignore no-space mode.  While the @code{sv}

@Defreg {nl}
@cindex current vertical position (@code{nl})

This register contains the current vertical position.  If the vertical
position is zero and the top of page transition hasn't happened yet,
@code{nl} is negative.  GNU @code{troff} itself does this at the very
beginning of a document before anything has been printed---but the main
application for such a value is to plant and spring a header trap on a
page if that page has already started (@pxref{Traps}).

@Example

The @code{ft} request and the @code{\f} escape change the current font
to @var{font} (one-character name@tie{}@var{f}, two-character name
@var{fn}).

If @var{font} is a style name (as set with the @code{sty} request or
with the @code{styles} command in the @file{DESC} file), use it within
the current font family (as set with the @code{fam} request, the
@code{\F} escape, or the @code{family} command in the @file{DESC} file).

It is not possible to switch to a font with the name @samp{DESC}
(whereas this name could be used as a style name; however, this is not
recommended).

@cindex previous font (@code{ft}, @code{\f[]}, @code{\fP})
@cindex font, previous (@code{ft}, @code{\f[]}, @code{\fP})
With no argument or using @samp{P} as an argument, @code{ft} switches
to the previous font.  Use @code{\f[]} to do this with an escape
sequence.  The old syntax forms @code{\fP} or @code{\f[P]} are also
supported.

Fonts are generally specified as uppercase strings, which are usually
1@tie{}to 4 characters representing an abbreviation or acronym of the
font name.  This is no limitation, just a convention.

The example below produces two identical lines.

@Example
eggs, bacon,
.ft B

eggs, bacon, \fBspam\fP and sausage.
@endExample

@code{\f} doesn't produce an input token in GNU @code{troff}.  As a
consequence, it can be used in requests like @code{mc} (which expects a
single character as an argument) to change the font on the fly:

@Example
.mc \f[I]x\f[]
@endExample

The current style name is available in the read-only string-valued
register @samp{.sty}; it is associated with the environment

to adjust the optical size of a font in relation to the others.  In the
example below, font @code{CR} is magnified by 10% (the zoom factor is
thus 1.1).

@Example
.fam P
.fzoom CR 1100
.ps 12
Palatino and \f[CR]Courier\f[]
@endExample

A missing or zero value of @var{zoom} is the same as a value of 1000,
which means no magnification.  @var{f}@tie{}must be a real font name,
not a style.

The magnification of a font is completely transparent to GNU
@code{troff}; a change of the zoom factor doesn't cause any effect
except that the dimensions of glyphs, (word) spaces, kerns, etc., of the
affected font are adjusted accordingly.

The zoom factor of the current font is available in the read-only
register @samp{.zoom}, in multiples of 1/1000th.  It returns zero if
there is no magnification.

Due to the variety of fonts available, @code{gtroff} has added the
concept of @dfn{font families} and @dfn{font styles}.  The fonts are

Currently, fonts for the devices @option{-Tps}, @option{-Tpdf},

previous font family, or the default family if there is none.  Use
@samp{\F[]} to do this with an escape sequence; @samp{\FP} selects font
family @samp{P} instead.  The initial font family is @samp{T} (Times),
but can be overridden by the output device description file---@xref{DESC
File Format}.  The current font family is available in the read-only
string-valued register @code{.fam}; it is associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).

@Example
spam,
.fam H    \" helvetica family
spam,     \" used font is family H + style R = HR
.ft B     \" family H + style B = font HB
spam,
.fam T    \" times family
spam,     \" used font is family T + style B = TB
.ft AR    \" font AR (not a style)
baked beans,
.ft R     \" family T + style R = font TR
and spam.
@endExample

@code{\F} doesn't produce an input token in GNU @code{troff}.  As a
consequence, it can be used in requests like @code{mc} (which expects
a single character as an argument) to change the font family on the fly.

@Example
.mc \F[P]x\F[]
@endExample

The read-only string-valued register @code{.fn} contains the current
@dfn{real font name} of the current font.  If the current font is a
style, the value of @code{\n[.fn]} is the proper concatenation of family
and style name.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {sty, n style}

@cindex @code{bd} request, and font styles
@cindex @code{tkf} request, and font styles
@cindex @code{uf} request, and font styles
@cindex @code{fspecial} request, and font styles
Associate @var{style} with font position@tie{}@var{n}.  A font position
can be associated either with a font or with a style.  The current font
is the index of a font position and so is also either a font or a style.
If it is a style, the font that is actually used is the font whose name
is the concatenation of the name of the current family and the name of
the current style.  For example, if the current font is@tie{}1 and font
position@tie{}1 is associated with style @samp{R} and the current font
family is @samp{T}, then font @samp{TR} is used.  If the current font is
not a style, then the current family is ignored.  If the requests
@code{cs}, @code{bd}, @code{tkf}, @code{uf}, or @code{fspecial} are
applied to a style, they are instead applied to the member of the
current family corresponding to that style.

@var{n}@tie{}must be a non-negative integer.

@pindex DESC
@kindex styles
The default family can be set with the @option{-f} option (@pxref{Groff
Options}).  The @code{styles} command in the @file{DESC} file controls
which font positions (if any) are initially associated with styles
rather than fonts.  For example, the default setting for PostScript
fonts

@Example
styles R I B BI
@endExample

@noindent
is equivalent to

@Example
.sty 1 R
.sty 2 I
.sty 3 B
.sty 4 BI
@endExample

@code{fam} and @code{\F} always check whether the current font position
is valid; this can give surprising results if the current font position
is associated with a style.

In the following example, we want to access the PostScript font
@code{FooBar} from the font family @code{Foo}:

@Example
.sty \n[.fp] Bar
.fam Foo
    @error{} warning: can't find font 'FooR'
@endExample

@noindent
The default font position at startup is@tie{}1; for the PostScript
device, this is associated with style @samp{R}, so @code{gtroff} tries
to open @code{FooR}.

A solution to this problem is to use a dummy font like the following:

@Example
.fp 0 dummy TR    \" set up dummy font at position 0
.sty \n[.fp] Bar  \" register style `Bar'
.ft 0             \" switch to font at position 0
.fam Foo          \" activate family `Foo'
.ft Bar           \" switch to font `FooBar'

@node Font Positions, Using Symbols, Font Families, Fonts and Symbols
@subsection Font Positions
@cindex font positions
@cindex positions, font

For compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, GNU @code{troff}
has the concept of font @dfn{positions} at which various fonts are
@dfn{mounted}.

@DefreqList {fp, pos font [@Var{external-name}]}
@DefregItemx {.f}
@DefregListEndx {.fp}
@cindex mounting font (@code{fp})
@cindex font, mounting (@code{fp})
Mount font @var{font} at position @var{pos} (which must be a
non-negative integer).  This numeric index can then be referred to with
font-changing commands.  When GNU @code{troff} starts, it uses font
position@tie{}1 (which must exist; position@tie{}0 is unused at
startup.@footnote{Usually.})

@cindex font position register (@code{.f})
The current font in use, as a font position, is available in the
read-only register @samp{.f}.  This can be useful to save the current
font for later recall.  It is associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).

@Example
.nr save-font \n[.f]
.ft B
... text text text ...
.ft \n[save-font]
@endExample

@cindex next free font position register (@code{.fp})
The index of the next free font position is available in the read-only
register @samp{.fp}.  This is useful when mounting a new font, like so:

@Example
.fp \n[.fp] NEATOFONT
@endExample

@pindex DESC@r{, and font mounting}
Fonts not listed in the @file{DESC} file are automatically mounted on
the next available font position when they are referenced.  If a font is
to be mounted explicitly with the @code{fp} request on an unused font
position, it should be mounted on the first unused font position, which
can be found in the @code{.fp} register, although GNU @code{troff} does
not enforce this strictly.

The @code{fp} request has an optional third argument.  This argument
gives the external name of the font, which is used for finding the font
description file.  The second argument gives the internal name of the
font, which is used to refer to the font in @code{gtroff} after it has
been mounted.  If there is no third argument then the internal name is
used as the external name.  This feature makes it possible to use fonts
with long names in compatibility mode.
@endDefreq

Both the @code{ft} request and the @code{\f} escape have alternative
syntax forms to access font positions.

@DefreqList {ft, nnn}
@DefescItemx {\\f, , n, }
@DefescItem {\\f, (, nn, }
@DefescListEnd {\\f, [, nnn, ]}

@cindex @code{sty} request, and font positions
@cindex @code{fam} request, and font positions
@cindex @code{\F}, and font positions
@kindex styles
@kindex family
@pindex DESC
Change the current font position to @var{nnn} (one-digit
position@tie{}@var{n}, two-digit position @var{nn}), which must be a
non-negative integer.

If @var{nnn} is associated with a style (as set with the @code{sty}
request or with the @code{styles} command in the @file{DESC} file), use
it within the current font family (as set with the @code{fam} request,
the @code{\F} escape, or the @code{family} command in the
@file{DESC} file).

@Example
this is font 1
.ft 2
this is font 2
.ft                   \" switch back to font 1
.ft 3
this is font 3
.ft
this is font 1 again

@cindex glyph
@cindex character
@cindex glyph, distinguished from character
@cindex character, distinguished from glyph
@cindex ligature
A @dfn{glyph} is a graphical representation of a @dfn{character}.  While
a character is an abstract entity containing semantic information, a
glyph is something that can be actually seen on screen or paper.  It is
possible that a character has multiple glyph representation forms (for
example, the character `A' can be either written in a roman or an italic
font, yielding two different glyphs); sometimes more than one character
maps to a single glyph (this is a @dfn{ligature}---the most common is
`fi').

@cindex symbol
@cindex special fonts
@kindex fonts
@pindex DESC
@cindex @code{special} request, and glyph search order
@cindex @code{fspecial} request, and glyph search order
A @dfn{symbol} is simply a named glyph.  Within @code{gtroff}, all glyph
names of a particular font are defined in its font file.  If the user
requests a glyph not available in this font, @code{gtroff} looks up an
ordered list of @dfn{special fonts}.  By default, the PostScript output
device supports the two special fonts @samp{SS} (slanted symbols) and
@samp{S} (symbols) (the former is looked up before the latter).  Other
output devices use different names for special fonts.  Fonts mounted
with the @code{fonts} keyword in the @file{DESC} file are globally
available.  To install additional special fonts locally (i.e., for a
particular font), use the @code{fspecial} request.

Here are the exact rules how @code{gtroff} searches a given symbol:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If the symbol has been defined with the @code{char} request, use it.
This hides a symbol with the same name in the current font.

@item
Check the current font.

@item
If the symbol has been defined with the @code{fchar} request, use it.

@item
Check whether the current font has a font-specific list of special
fonts; test all fonts in the order of appearance in the last
@code{fspecial} call if appropriate.

@item
If the symbol has been defined with the @code{fschar} request for the
current font, use it.

@item
Check all fonts in the order of appearance in the last @code{special}
call.

@item
If the symbol has been defined with the @code{schar} request, use it.

@item
As a last resort, consult all fonts loaded up to now for special fonts
and check them, starting with the lowest font number.  This can
sometimes lead to surprising results since the @code{fonts} line in
the @file{DESC} file often contains empty positions, which are filled
later on.  For example, consider the following:

@Example
fonts 3 0 0 FOO
@endExample

@noindent
This mounts font @code{foo} at font position@tie{}3.  We assume that
@code{FOO} is a special font, containing glyph @code{foo}, and that no
font has been loaded yet.  The line

@Example
.fspecial BAR BAZ
@endExample

@noindent
makes font @code{BAZ} special only if font @code{BAR} is active.  We
further assume that @code{BAZ} is really a special font, i.e., the font
description file contains the @code{special} keyword, and that it also
contains glyph @code{foo} with a special shape fitting to font
@code{BAR}.  After executing @code{fspecial}, font @code{BAR} is loaded
at font position@tie{}1, and @code{BAZ} at position@tie{}2.

We now switch to a new font @code{XXX}, trying to access glyph
@code{foo} that is assumed to be missing.  There are neither
font-specific special fonts for @code{XXX} nor any other fonts made
special with the @code{special} request, so @code{gtroff} starts the
search for special fonts in the list of already mounted fonts, with
increasing font positions.  Consequently, it finds @code{BAZ} before
@code{FOO} even for @code{XXX}, which is not the intended behaviour.

Glyph names not listed in @cite{groff_char@r{(7)}} are derived
algorithmically, using a simplified version of the Adobe Glyph List
(AGL) algorithm, which is described in
@uref{https://github.com@//adobe-type-tools@//agl-aglfn}.  The (frozen)
set of glyph names that can't be derived algorithmically is called the
@dfn{@code{groff} glyph list (GGL)}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
A glyph for Unicode character U+@var{XXXX}[@var{X}[@var{X}]], which is
not a composite character is named
@code{u@var{XXXX}@r{[}@var{X}@r{[}@var{X}@r{]]}}.  @var{X} must be an
uppercase hexadecimal digit.  Examples: @code{u1234}, @code{u008E},
@code{u12DB8}.  The largest Unicode value is 0x10FFFF.  There must be at
least four @code{X} digits; if necessary, add leading zeroes (after the
@samp{u}).  No zero padding is allowed for character codes greater than
0xFFFF.  Surrogates (i.e., Unicode values greater than 0xFFFF
represented with character codes from the surrogate area U+D800-U+DFFF)
are not allowed either.

@item
A glyph representing more than a single input character is named

@display
@samp{u} @var{component1} @samp{_} @var{component2} @samp{_} @var{component3} @dots{}
@end display

@noindent
Example: @code{u0045_0302_0301}.

For simplicity, all Unicode characters that are composites must be
maximally decomposed to NFD;@footnote{This is ``Normalization Form D''
as documented in Unicode Standard Annex #15
(@uref{https://unicode.org@//reports@//tr15/}).} for example,
@code{u00CA_0301} is not a valid glyph name since U+00CA (@sc{latin
capital letter e with circumflex}) can be further decomposed into U+0045
(@sc{latin capital letter e}) and U+0302 (@sc{combining circumflex
accent}).  @code{u0045_0302_0301} is thus the glyph name for U+1EBE,
@sc{latin capital letter e with circumflex and acute}.

@item
groff maintains a table to decompose all algorithmically derived glyph
names that are composites itself.  For example, @code{u0100} (@sc{latin
letter a with macron}) is automatically decomposed into
@code{u0041_0304}.  Additionally, a glyph name of the GGL is preferred
to an algorithmically derived glyph name; @code{groff} also
automatically does the mapping.  Example: The glyph @code{u0045_0302} is
mapped to @code{^E}.

@item
glyph names of the GGL can't be used in composite glyph names; for
example, @code{^E_u0301} is invalid.
@end itemize

@DefescList {\\, (, nm, }
@DefescItem {\\, [, name, ]}
@DefescListEnd {\\, [, component1 component2 @dots{}, ]}
Insert a symbol @var{name} (two-character name @var{nm}) or a composite
glyph with component glyphs @var{component1}, @var{component2},
@enddots{}  There is no special syntax for one-character names---the
natural form @samp{\@var{n}} would collide with other escape
sequences.@footnote{A one-character symbol is not the same as an input
character, i.e., the character @code{a} is not the same as @code{\[a]}.
By default, @code{groff} defines only a single one-character symbol,
@code{\[-]}; it is usually accessed as @code{\-}.  On the other hand,
GNU @code{troff} has the special feature that @code{\[char@var{XXX}]} is
the same as the input character with character code @var{XXX}.  For
example, @code{\[char97]} is identical to the letter @code{a} if
@acronym{ASCII} encoding is active.}

If @var{name} is undefined, a warning in category @samp{char} is
produced and the escape is ignored.  @xref{Debugging}, for information
about the enablement and suppression of warnings.

GNU @code{troff} resolves @code{\[@r{@dots{}}]} with more than a single
component as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Any component that is found in the GGL is converted to the
@code{u@var{XXXX}} form.

@item
Any component @code{u@var{XXXX}} that is found in the list of
decomposable glyphs is decomposed.

@item
The resulting elements are then concatenated with @samp{_} in between,
dropping the leading @samp{u} in all elements but the first.
@end itemize

No check for the existence of any component (similar to @code{tr}
request) is done.

Examples:

@table @code
@item \[A ho]
@samp{A} maps to @code{u0041}, @samp{ho} maps to @code{u02DB}, thus the
final glyph name would be @code{u0041_02DB}.  Note this is not the
expected result: The ogonek glyph @samp{ho} is a spacing ogonek, but for
a proper composite a non-spacing ogonek (U+0328) is necessary.  Looking
into the file @file{composite.tmac} one can find @w{@samp{.composite ho
u0328}}, which changes the mapping of @samp{ho} while a composite glyph
name is constructed, causing the final glyph name to be
@code{u0041_0328}.

@item \[^E u0301]
@itemx \[^E aa]
@itemx \[E a^ aa]
@itemx \[E ^ @code{'}]
@samp{^E} maps to @code{u0045_0302}, thus the final glyph name is
@code{u0045_0302_0301} in all forms (assuming proper calls of the
@code{composite} request).
@end table

It is not possible to define glyphs with names like @w{@samp{A ho}}
within a @code{groff} font file.  This is not really a limitation;
instead, you have to define @code{u0041_0328}.

have glyphs with codes between 0 and@tie{}255; the Unicode output device
uses codes in the range 0--65535.  If the current font does not contain
a glyph with that code, special fonts are @emph{not} searched.  The
@code{\N} escape sequence can be conveniently used in conjunction with
the @code{char} request:

@samp{---}; the @code{\N} escape sequence is the only way to use these.

No kerning is applied to glyphs accessed with @code{\N}.

@cindex @code{dg} glyph, at end of sentence
@cindex @code{dd} glyph, at end of sentence
@cindex @code{rq} glyph, at end of sentence
@cindex @code{cq} glyph, at end of sentence
Mark the character as transparent for the purpose of end-of-sentence
recognition.  In other words, an end-of-sentence character followed by
any number of characters with this property is treated as the end of a
sentence if followed by a newline or two spaces.  This is the same as
having a zero space factor in @TeX{}.  Initially, characters
@samp{"')]*\[dg]\[dd]\[rq]\[cq]} have this property.

@item 64
Ignore hyphenation codes of the surrounding characters.  Use this in
combination with values 2 and@tie{}4 (initially, no characters have this
property).

For example, if you need an automatic break point after the en-dash in
numerical ranges like ``3000--5000'', insert

@Example
.cflags 68 \[en]
@endExample

@noindent
into your document.  Note, however, that this can lead to bad layout if
done without thinking; in most situations, a better solution instead of
changing the @code{cflags} value is to insert @code{\:} right after the
hyphen at the places that really need a break point.
@end table

The remaining values were implemented for East Asian language support;
those who use alphabetic scripts exclusively can disregard them.

@table @code
@item 128
Prohibit a line break before the character, but allow a line break after
the character.  This works only in combination with flags 256 and 512
and has no effect otherwise.  Initially, no characters have this
property.

@item 256
Prohibit a line break after the character, but allow a line break before
the character.  This works only in combination with flags 128 and 512
and has no effect otherwise.  Initially, no characters have this
property.

@item 512
Allow line break before or after the character.  This works only in
combination with flags 128 and 256 and has no effect otherwise.
Initially, no characters have this property.
@end table

In contrast to values 2 and@tie{}4, the values 128, 256, and 512 work
pairwise.  If, for example, the left character has value 512, and the
right character 128, no break will be automatically inserted between
them.  If we use value@tie{}6 instead for the left character, a break
after the character can't be suppressed since the neighboring character
on the right doesn't get examined.

@cindex @code{hcode} request, and glyph definitions
Define a new character or glyph@tie{}@var{g} to be @var{string}, which
can be empty.  More precisely, @code{char} defines a @code{groff} object
(or redefines an existing one) that is accessed with the
name@tie{}@var{g} on input, and produces @var{string} on output.  Every
time glyph@tie{}@var{g} needs to be printed, @var{string} is processed
in a temporary environment and the result is wrapped up into a single
object.  Compatibility mode is turned off and the escape character is
set to@tie{}@code{\} while @var{string} is processed.  Any emboldening,
constant spacing, or track kerning is applied to this object rather than
to individual glyphs in @var{string}.

An object defined by these requests can be used just like a normal glyph
provided by the output device.  In particular, other characters can be
translated to it with the @code{tr} or @code{trin} requests; it can be
made the leader character with the @code{lc} request; repeated patterns
can be drawn with it using the @code{\l} and @code{\L} escape sequences;
and words containing@tie{}@var{g}  can be hyphenated correctly if the
@code{hcode} request is used to give the object a hyphenation code.

There is a special anti-recursion feature: use of the object within its
own definition is handled like a normal character (not
defined with @code{char}).

The @code{tr} and @code{trin} requests take precedence if @code{char}
accesses the same symbol.

@Example
.tr XY
X
    @result{} Y
.char X Z
X
    @result{} Y
.tr XX
X
    @result{} Z
@endExample

The @code{fchar} request defines a fallback glyph: @code{gtroff} only
checks for glyphs defined with @code{fchar} if it cannot find the glyph
in the current font.  @code{gtroff} carries out this test before
checking special fonts.

@code{fschar} defines a fallback glyph for font@tie{}@var{f}:
@code{gtroff} checks for glyphs defined with @code{fschar} after the
list of fonts declared as font-specific special fonts with the
@code{fspecial} request, but before the list of fonts declared as global
special fonts with the @code{special} request.

Finally, the @code{schar} request defines a global fallback glyph:
@code{gtroff} checks for glyphs defined with @code{schar} after the list
of fonts declared as global special fonts with the @code{special}
request, but before the already mounted special fonts.

@node Character Classes, Special Fonts, Using Symbols, Fonts and Symbols
@subsection Character Classes
@cindex character classes
@cindex classes, character

Classes are particularly useful for East Asian languages such as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, where the number of needed characters is
much larger than in European languages, and where large sets of
characters share the same properties.

@Defreq {class, name c1 c2 @dots{}}
@cindex character class (@code{class})
@cindex defining character class (@code{class})
@cindex class of characters (@code{class})
Define a character class (or simply ``class'') @var{name} comprising
the characters @var{c1}, @var{c2}, and so on.

A class thus defined can then be referred to in lieu of listing all the
characters within it.  Currently, only the @code{cflags} request can
handle references to character classes.

In the request's simplest form, each @var{cn} is a character (or special
character).

@Example
.class [quotes] ' \[aq] \[dq] \[oq] \[cq] \[lq] \[rq]
@endExample

Since class and glyph names share the same name space, it is recommended
to start and end the class name with @code{[} and @code{]},
respectively, to avoid collisions with existing character names defined
by GNU @code{troff} or the user (with @code{char} and related requests).
This practice applies the presence of @code{]} in the class name to
prevent the use of the special character escape form
@code{\[@r{@dots{}}]}, thus you must use the @code{\C} escape to access
a class with such a name.

@cindex GGL (@code{groff} glyph list)
@cindex @code{groff} glyph list (GGL)
You can also use a character range notation consisting of a
start character followed by @samp{-} and then an end character.
Internally, GNU @code{troff} converts these two symbol names to
Unicode code points (according to the @code{groff} glyph list [GGL]),
which then give the start and end value of the range.  If that fails,
the class definition is skipped.

Furthermore, classes can be nested.

@Example
.class [prepunct] , : ; > @}
.class [prepunctx] \C'[prepunct]' \[u2013]-\[u2016]
@endExample

@noindent
The class @samp{[prepunctx]} thus contains the contents of the class
@code{[prepunct]} as defined above (the set @samp{, : ; > @}}), and
characters in the range between @code{U+2013} and @code{U+2016}.

If you want to include @samp{-} in a class, it must be the first
character value in the argument list, otherwise it gets misinterpreted
as part of the range syntax.

It is not possible to use class names as end points of range
definitions.

A typical use of the @code{class} request is to control line-breaking
and hyphenation rules as defined by the @code{cflags} request.  For
example, to inhibit line breaks before the characters belonging to the
@code{prepunctx} class defined in the previous example, you can write
the following.

@Example
.cflags 2 \C'[prepunctx]'
@endExample

@noindent
See the @code{cflags} request in @ref{Using Symbols}, for more details.

@cindex special fonts
@cindex fonts, special

Special fonts are those that @code{gtroff} searches when it cannot find
the requested glyph in the current font.  The Symbol font is usually a
special font.

@code{gtroff} provides the following two requests to add more special
fonts.  @xref{Using Symbols}, for a detailed description of the glyph
searching mechanism in @code{gtroff}.

Usually, only non-TTY devices have special fonts.

Use the @code{fspecial} request to designate special fonts only when
font@tie{}@var{f} is active.  Initially, this list is empty.

Previous calls to @code{special} or @code{fspecial} are overwritten;
without arguments, the particular list of special fonts is set to empty.
Special fonts are searched in the order they appear as arguments.

@node Artificial Fonts, Ligatures and Kerning, Special Fonts, Fonts and Symbols
@subsection Artificial Fonts
@cindex artificial fonts
@cindex fonts, artificial

There are a number of requests and escape sequences for artificially
creating fonts.  These are largely vestiges of the days when output
devices did not have a wide variety of fonts, and when @code{nroff} and
@code{troff} were separate programs.  Most of them are no longer
necessary in GNU @code{troff}.  Nevertheless, they are supported.

@DefescList {\\H, @code{'}, height, @code{'}}
@DefescItem {\\H, @code{'}, @t{+}height, @code{'}}
@DefescItem {\\H, @code{'}, @t{-}height, @code{'}}
@DefregListEndx {.height}
@cindex changing the font height (@code{\H})
@cindex font height, changing (@code{\H})
@cindex height, font, changing (@code{\H})
Change (increment, decrement) the height of the current font, but not
the width.  If @var{height} is zero, restore the original height.
Default scaling indicator is @samp{z}.

The read-only register @code{.height} contains the font height as set by
@code{\H}.

Currently, only the @option{-Tps} and @option{-Tpdf} devices support
this feature.

@code{\H} doesn't produce an input token in GNU @code{troff}.  As a
consequence, it can be used in requests like @code{mc} (which expects
a single character as an argument) to change the font on the fly:

@Example
.mc \H'+5z'x\H'0'
@endExample

In compatibility mode, @code{gtroff} behaves differently: If an
increment or decrement is used, it is always taken relative to the
current type size and not relative to the previously selected font
height.  Thus,

@Example
.cp 1
\H'+5'test \H'+5'test
@endExample

@noindent
prints the word @samp{test} twice with the same font height (five points
larger than the current font size).

@cindex changing the font slant (@code{\S})
@cindex font slant, changing (@code{\S})
@cindex slant, font, changing (@code{\S})
Slant the current font by @var{slant} degrees.  Positive values slant to
the right.  Only integer values are possible.

The read-only register @code{.slant} contains the font slant as set by
@code{\S}.

Currently, only the @option{-Tps} and @option{-Tpdf} devices support
this feature.

@code{\S} doesn't produce an input token in GNU @code{troff}.  As a
consequence, it can be used in requests like @code{mc} (which expects
a single character as an argument) to change the font on the fly:

@Example
.mc \S'20'x\S'0'

@cindex CSTR@tie{}#54 errata

@endDefesc

@Defreq {ul, [@Var{lines}]}
@cindex underlining (@code{ul})
The @code{ul} request normally underlines subsequent lines if a TTY
output device is used.  Otherwise, the lines are printed in italics
(only the term `underlined' is used in the following).  The single
argument is the quantity of input lines to be underlined; with no
argument, the next line is underlined.  If @var{lines} is zero or
negative, stop the effects of @code{ul} (if it was active).  Requests
and empty lines do not count for computing the number of underlined
input lines, even if they produce some output like @code{tl}.  Lines
inserted by macros (e.g., invoked by a trap) do count.

At the beginning of @code{ul}, the current font is stored and the
underline font is activated.  Within the span of a @code{ul} request, it
is possible to change fonts, but after the last line affected by
@code{ul} the saved font is restored.

This number of lines still to be underlined is associated with the
environment (@pxref{Environments}).  The underline font can be changed
with the @code{uf} request.

Two syntax forms are available.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Imitate a bold font unconditionally.  The first argument specifies the
font to embolden, and the second is the number of basic units, minus
one, by which the two glyphs are offset.  If the second argument is
missing, emboldening is turned off.

@var{font} can be either a non-negative font position or the name of a
font.

@var{offset} is available in the @code{.b} read-only register if a
special font is active; in the @code{bd} request, its default unit is
@samp{u}.

@node Ligatures and Kerning,  , Artificial Fonts, Fonts and Symbols
@subsection Ligatures and Kerning
@cindex ligatures and kerning
@cindex kerning and ligatures

Ligatures are groups of characters that are run together, i.e, producing
a single glyph.  For example, the letters `f' and `i' can form a
ligature `fi' as in the word `file'.  This produces a cleaner look
(albeit subtle) to the printed output.  Usually, ligatures are not
available in fonts for TTY output devices.

Most PostScript fonts support the fi and fl ligatures.  The C/A/T
typesetter that was the target of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} also
supported `ff', `ffi', and `ffl' ligatures.  Advanced typesetters or
`expert' fonts may include ligatures for `ft' and `ct', although GNU
@code{troff} does not support these (yet).

Only the current font is checked for ligatures and kerns; neither
special fonts nor entities defined with the @code{char} request (and its
siblings) are taken into account.

@DefreqList {lg, [@Var{flag}]}
@DefregListEndx {.lg}
@cindex activating ligatures (@code{lg})
@cindex ligatures, activating (@code{lg})
@cindex ligatures enabled register (@code{.lg})
Switch the ligature mechanism on or off; if the parameter is non-zero or
missing, ligatures are enabled, otherwise disabled.  Default is on.  The
current ligature mode can be found in the read-only register @code{.lg}
(set to 1 or@tie{}2 if ligatures are enabled, 0@tie{}otherwise).

Setting the ligature mode to@tie{}2 enables the two-character ligatures
(fi, fl, and ff) and disables the three-character ligatures (ffi and
ffl).
@endDefreq

@dfn{Pairwise kerning} is another subtle typesetting mechanism that
modifies the distance between a glyph pair to improve readability.  In
most cases (but not always) the distance is decreased.
@iftex
For example, compare the combination of the letters `V' and `A'.  With
kerning, `VA' is printed.  Without kerning it appears as `V@w{}A'.
@end iftex
Typewriter-like fonts and fonts for terminals where all glyphs have the
same width don't use kerning.

@xref{Font Description File Format}.
@endDefreq

@cindex track kerning
@cindex kerning, track
@dfn{Track kerning} expands or reduces the space between glyphs.  This
can be handy, for example, if you need to squeeze a long word onto a
single line or spread some text to fill a narrow column.  It must be
used with great care since it is usually considered bad typography if
the reader notices the effect.

@Defreq {tkf, f s1 n1 s2 n2}
@cindex activating track kerning (@code{tkf})
@cindex track kerning, activating (@code{tkf})
Enable track kerning for font@tie{}@var{f}.  If the current font
is@tie{}@var{f} the width of every glyph is increased by an amount
between @var{n1} and @var{n2} (@var{n1}, @var{n2} can be negative); if
the current type size is less than or equal to @var{s1} the width is
increased by @var{n1}; if it is greater than or equal to @var{s2} the
width is increased by @var{n2}; if the type size is greater than or
equal to @var{s1} and less than or equal to @var{s2} the increase in
width is a linear function of the type size.

The default scaling indicator is @samp{z} for @var{s1} and @var{s2},
@samp{p} for @var{n1} and @var{n2}.

The track kerning amount is added even to the rightmost glyph in a line;
for large values it is thus recommended to increase the line length by
the same amount to compensate.
@endDefreq

Sometimes, when typesetting letters of different fonts, more or less
space at such boundaries is needed.  There are two escape sequences to
help with this.

@Defesc {\\/, , , }
@cindex italic correction (@code{\/})

@cindex correction between oblique and upright glyph (@code{\/}, @code{\,})
@cindex roman glyph, correction after italic glyph (@code{\/})
@cindex upright glyph, correction after oblique glyph (@code{\/})
Apply an @dfn{italic correction}:@: modify the spacing of the preceding
glyph so that the distance between it and the following glyph is correct
if the latter is of upright shape.  For example, if an
italic@tie{}@samp{f} is followed immediately by a roman right
parenthesis, then in many fonts the top right portion of
the@tie{}@samp{f} overlaps the top left of the right parenthesis, which
is ugly.  Use this escape sequence whenever an oblique glyph is
immediately followed by an upright glyph without any intervening space.
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\\,, , , }
@cindex left italic correction (@code{\,})

@cindex upright glyph, correction before oblique glyph (@code{\,})
Apply a @dfn{left italic correction}:@: modify the spacing of the
following glyph so that the distance between it and the preceding
glyph is correct if the latter is of upright shape.  For example,
if a roman left parenthesis is immediately followed by an
italic@tie{}@samp{f}, then in many fonts the bottom left portion of
the@tie{}@samp{f} overlaps the bottom of the left parenthesis, which is
ugly.  Use this escape sequence whenever an upright glyph is followed
immediately by an oblique glyph without any intervening space.
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\&, , , }
Insert a non-printing input break, which is invisible.  Its intended use
is to stop interaction of a character with its surroundings.

Its main usage is in macro definitions to protect against arguments
starting with a control character.

@cindex baseline
@cindex type size
@cindex size of type
@cindex vertical spacing
@cindex spacing, vertical
GNU @code{troff} uses two dimensions with each line of text, type size
and vertical spacing.  The @dfn{type size} is approximately the height
of the tallest glyph.@footnote{This is usually the parenthesis.  In most
cases the real dimensions of the glyphs in a font are @emph{not} related
to its type size!  For example, the standard PostScript font families
`Times', `Helvetica', and `Courier' can't be used together at
10@dmn{pt}; to get acceptable output, the size of `Helvetica' has to be
reduced by one point, and the size of `Courier' must be increased by one
point.}  @dfn{Vertical spacing} is the amount of space @code{gtroff}
allows for a line of text; normally, this is about 20%@tie{}larger than
the current type size.  Ratios smaller than this can result in
hard-to-read text; larger than this, it spreads the text out more
vertically (useful for term papers).  By default, @code{gtroff} uses
10@tie{}point type on 12@tie{}point spacing.

@cindex leading
Typesetters call the difference between type size and vertical spacing
@dfn{leading}.@footnote{This is pronounced to rhyme with ``sledding'',

@xref{Fractional Type Sizes}, for additional syntactical forms of
the @code{\s} escape (which accept integers as well as fractions).
@endDefreq

Note that @code{\s} doesn't produce an input token in @code{gtroff}.  As
a consequence, it can be used in requests like @code{mc} (which expects
a single character as an argument) to change the font on the fly:

@Example
.mc \s[20]x\s[0]
@endExample

@Defreq {sizes, s1 s2 @dots{} sn [@t{0}]}
Some devices may permit only certain type sizes, in which case GNU
@code{troff} rounds to the nearest permissible size.  The @file{DESC}
file normally specifies which type sizes are allowed by the device.

Use the @code{sizes} request to change the permissible sizes for the
output device.  Arguments are in scaled points; the @code{sizescale}
line in the @file{DESC} file for the output device provides the scaling
factor.  For example, if the scaling factor is 1000, then the value
12000 is 12@tie{}points.

Each argument can be a single type size (such as @samp{12000}), or a
range of sizes (such as @samp{4000-72000}).  You can optionally end the
list with a zero.

If @code{vs} is called without an argument, the vertical spacing is
reset to the previous value before the last call to @code{vs}.

@cindex @code{.V} register, and @code{vs}
@code{gtroff} creates a warning in category @samp{range} if @var{space}

@w{@samp{.vs 0}} isn't saved in a diversion since it doesn't result in
a vertical motion.  You explicitly have to repeat this command before
inserting the diversion.

@cindex vertical line spacing, effective value
The effective vertical line spacing consists of four components.
Breaking a line causes the following actions (in the given order).

@itemize @bullet

@cindex line space, extra pre-vertical (@code{\x})
Move the current point vertically by the @dfn{extra pre-vertical line

with a negative argument in the current output line.

@item
Move the current point vertically by the vertical line spacing as set

@item
Output the current line.

@item
@cindex extra post-vertical line space (@code{\x})
@cindex line space, extra post-vertical (@code{\x})
Move the current point vertically by the @dfn{extra post-vertical line

with a positive argument in the line that has just been output.

@item

@cindex double-spacing (@code{vs}, @code{pvs})
It is usually better to use @code{vs} or @code{pvs} instead of @code{ls}

finer granularity for the inserted vertical space than @code{ls};
furthermore, certain preprocessors assume single spacing.

The default scaling indicator is @samp{p}.

If @code{pvs} is called without an argument, the post-vertical spacing
is reset to the previous value before the last call to @code{pvs}.

@code{gtroff} creates a warning in category @samp{range} if @var{space}

A @dfn{scaled point} is equal to @math{1/@var{sizescale}} points, where
@var{sizescale} is specified in the device description file @file{DESC},
and defaults to@tie{}1.  A new scaling indicator @samp{z} has the effect
of multiplying by @var{sizescale}.  Requests and escape sequences in GNU
@code{troff} interpret arguments that represent a type size as being in
units of scaled points; that is, they evaluate each such argument using
a default scaling indicator of @samp{z}.  Arguments treated in this way
comprise those to the escape sequences @code{\H} and @code{\s}, to the
request @code{ps}, the third argument to the @code{cs} request, and the
second and fourth arguments to the @code{tkf} request.

For example, if @var{sizescale} is@tie{}1000, then a scaled point
is one one-thousandth of a point.  The request @samp{.ps 10.25} is
synonymous with @samp{.ps 10.25z} and sets the type size to
10250@tie{}scaled points, or 10.25@tie{}points.

Consequently, in GNU @code{troff}, the register @code{.s} can contain a
non-integral type size.

It makes no sense to use the @samp{z} scaling indicator in a numeric
expression whose default scaling indicator is neither @samp{u} nor
@samp{z}, so GNU @code{troff} disallows this.  Similarly, it is
nonsensical to use a scaling indicator other than @samp{z} or @samp{u}
in a numeric expression whose default scaling indicator is @samp{z}, and
so GNU @code{troff} disallows this as well.

Another new scaling indicator @samp{s} multiplies by the number of basic
units in a scaled point.  For instance, @samp{\n[.ps]s} is equal to
@samp{1m} by definition.  Do not confuse the @samp{s} and @samp{z} scale
indicators.

read-only register @code{.psr}.  The last-requested type size in points
as a decimal fraction can be found in the read-only string-valued
register @code{.sr}.  Both registers are associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).

The requested type sizes are device-independent, whereas the values
returned by the @code{.ps} and @code{.s} registers are not.  For
example, if a type size of 11@dmn{pt} is requested, and a @code{sizes}
request (or a @code{sizescale} line in a @file{DESC} file) specifies
10.95@dmn{pt} instead, this value is actually used.

@endDefreg

The @code{\s} escape has the following syntax for working with
fractional type sizes:

@table @code
@item \s[@var{n}]
@itemx \s'@var{n}'
Set the type size to @var{n}@tie{}scaled points; @var{n}@tie{}is a
numeric expression with a default scaling indicator of @samp{z}.

GNU @code{troff} supports color output with a variety of color spaces
and up to 16 bits per channel.  Some devices, particularly terminals,
may be more limited.  When color support is enabled, two colors are
current at any given time: the @dfn{stroke color}, with which glyphs,
rules (lines), and geometric objects like circles and polygons are
drawn, and the @dfn{fill color}, which can be used to paint the interior
of closed geometric figures.

@DefreqList {color, [@Var{n}]}
@DefregListEndx {.color}
If @var{n} is missing or non-zero, enable the output of color-related
device commands (this is the default); otherwise, disable them.

The read-only register @code{.color} is@tie{}1 if colors are enabled,
0@tie{}otherwise.

Internally, @code{color} sets a global flag; it does not produce a
token.  As with the @code{cp} request, you should use it at the
beginning of your document to control color output.

Colors can be also turned off with the @option{-c} command-line option.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {defcolor, ident scheme color-component @dots{}}
Define a color named @var{ident}.  @var{scheme} identifies a color space
and determines the quantity of required @var{color-component}s; it must
be one of @samp{rgb} (three components), @samp{cmy} (three components),
@samp{cmyk} (four components), or @samp{gray} (one component).
@samp{grey} is accepted as a synonym of @samp{gray}.  The color
components can be encoded as a hexadecimal value starting with @samp{#}
or @samp{##}.  The former indicates that each component is in the range
0--255 (0--FF), the latter the range 0--65535 (0--FFFF).

@code{ps}, and @code{xhtml} output devices, GNU @code{troff}
automatically loads a macro file defining many color names at startup.
By the same mechanism, the devices supported by @code{grotty} recognize

@cindex string arguments
@cindex arguments, of strings
Define a string variable @var{name} with contents @var{string}.  If
@var{name} already exists, it is removed first (see @code{rm} below).
The syntax form using brackets accepts arguments that are handled as
macro arguments are; recall @ref{Request and Macro Arguments}.  In
contrast to macro invocations, however, a closing bracket as a string
argument must be enclosed in double quotes.  @code{\\*} is interpreted
even in copy mode (@pxref{Copy Mode}).

The @code{\*} escape @dfn{interpolates} (expands in place) a previously
defined string variable @var{name} (one-character name@tie{}@var{n},
two-character name @var{nm}).  More precisely, the stored string is
pushed onto the input stack, which is then parsed normally.  Similarly
to registers, it is possible to nest strings; i.e., string variables can
be called within string variables.  An argument in a string definition
must be escaped for correct behavior;
@xref{Parameters}.

@Example
.ds a \\$1 wildebeest
.ds b big, \*[a hairy]
I see a \*[b].
    @result{} I see a big, hairy wildebeest.
@endExample

If the string named by the @code{\*} escape does not exist, it is
defined as empty, and a warning in category @samp{mac} is produced.
@xref{Debugging}, for information about the enablement and suppression
of warnings.

If @code{ds} is called with only one argument, @var{name} is defined as
an empty string.

@cindex trailing spaces in string definitions and appendments
@cindex comments, with @code{ds}
@cindex @code{ds} request, and comments
@strong{Caution:} Unlike other requests, the second argument to the
@code{ds} request consumes the remainder of the input line, including
trailing spaces.  This means that comments on a line with such a request
can introduce unwanted space into a string when they are set off from
the material they annotate, as is conventional.

@Example
.ds H2O H\v'+.3m'\s'-2'2\v'-.3m'\s0O \" water
@endExample

@noindent
Instead, place the comment on another line or put the comment escape
immediately adjacent to the last character of the string.

@Example
.ds H2O H\v'+.3m'\s'-2'2\v'-.3m'\s0O\" water
@endExample

It is good style to end string definitions (and appendments; see below)
with a comment, even an empty one, to prevent unwanted space from
creeping into them during source document maintenance.

.ds empty \" might be appended to later with .as

other location are included in the string (the effects of escape
sequences notwithstanding).

@c Examples should be more accessible than Unix nerd stuff like this,
@c but in general document authors shouldn't want to use "straight"
@c double quotes for ordinary prose anyway.  Also, 56 chars is as fat
@c as these examples can get and not overrun the right margin in PDF.
@Example
.ds salutation "         Yours in a white wine sauce,\"

@cindex escaping newline characters, in strings
Strings are not limited to a single line of input text.  A string can
span several lines by escaping the newlines with a backslash.  The
resulting string is stored @emph{without} the newlines.

@Example
.ds foo This string contains \
text on multiple lines \
of input.
@endExample

It is not possible to embed a newline in a string that will be
interpreted as such when the string is interpolated.  To achieve that
effect, use the @code{\*} escape to interpolate a macro instead.

Macros, strings, and diversions share a name space; see
@ref{Identifiers}.  Internally, the same mechanism is used to store
them.  You can thus call a macro with string interpolation syntax and
vice versa.

@Example
.de subject
Typesetting
..
.de predicate
rewards attention to detail
..
\*[subject] \*[predicate].
Truly.
    @result{} Typesetting
    @result{}  rewards attention to detail Truly.
@endExample

@noindent
What went wrong?  Strings don't contain newlines, but macros do.  String
interpolation placed a newline at the end of @samp{\*[subject]}, and the
next thing on the input was a space.  Similarly, when
@samp{\*[predicate]} was interpolated, it was followed by the empty
request @samp{.} on a line by itself.  If we want to use macros as
strings, we must take interpolation behavior into account.

@Example
.de subject
Typesetting\\
..
.de predicate
rewards attention to detail\\
..
\*[subject] \*[predicate].
Truly.
    @result{} Typesetting rewards attention to detail.  Truly.
@endExample

@noindent
By ending each text line of the macros with an escaped
@samp{\@key{RET}}, we get the desired effect (@pxref{Line
Continuation}).@footnote{The backslash is doubled.  @xref{Copy Mode}.}
What would have happened if we had used only one backslash at a time
instead?

Interpolating a string does not hide existing macro arguments.  We can
also place the escaped newline outside the string interpolation instead
of within the string definition.  Thus, in a macro, a more efficient way
of doing

@Example
.xx \\$@@
@endExample

@noindent
is

@Example
\\*[xx]\\
@endExample

@noindent
The latter calling syntax doesn't change the value of @code{\$0}, which
is then inherited from the calling macro (@pxref{Parameters}).

Diversions can be also called with string syntax.  It is sometimes
convenient to copy one-line diversions to a string.

@Example
.di xx
the
.ft I
interpolation system
.ft
.br
.di
.ds yy This is a test of \*(xx\c
\*(yy.
    @result{} This is a test of the @i{interpolation system}.
@endExample

@noindent
As the previous example shows, it is possible to store formatted output
in strings.  The @code{\c} escape prevents the subsequent newline from
being interpreted as a break (again, @pxref{Line Continuation}).

Copying diversions longer than a single output line produces unexpected
results.

@Example
.di xxx
a funny
.br
test
.br
.di
.ds yyy This is \*[xxx]\c
\*[yyy].
    @result{} test This is a funny.
@endExample

Usually, it is not predictable whether a diversion contains one or more
output lines, so this mechanism should be avoided.  With @acronym{AT&T}
@code{troff}, this was the only solution to strip off a final newline
from a diversion.  Another disadvantage is that the spaces in the copied
string are already formatted, preventing their adjustment.  This can
cause ugly results.

@cindex stripping final newline in diversions
@cindex diversion, stripping final newline
@cindex final newline, stripping in diversions
@cindex newline, final, stripping in diversions
@cindex horizontal space, unformatting
@cindex space, horizontal, unformatting
@cindex unformatting horizontal space
A clean solution to this problem is available in GNU @code{troff}, using
the requests @code{chop} to remove the final newline of a diversion, and
@code{unformat} to make the horizontal spaces adjustable again.

@Example
.box xxx
a funny
.br

.box
.chop xxx
.unformat xxx
This is \*[xxx].
    @result{} This is a funny test.

with only one argument, no operation is performed (beyond dereferencing
it).

@Example
.as salutation " with shallots, onions and garlic,\"

The @code{as1} request is similar to @code{as}, but compatibility mode

@Defreq {chop, object}
Remove the last character from the macro, string, or diversion named
@var{object}.  This is useful for removing the newline from the end of a

@endDefreq

@Defreq {substring, str start [@Var{end}]}
@cindex substring (@code{substring})
Replace the string named @var{str} with its substring bounded by the

Alter the string named @var{str} by replacing each of its bytes with

usually transform in the expected way due to the regular glyph naming
convention for accented characters.

Create an alias @var{new} for the existing request, string, macro, or
diversion object named @var{old}, causing the names to refer to the same
stored object.  If @var{old} is undefined, a warning in category
@samp{mac} is produced, and the request is ignored.  @xref{Debugging},
for information about the enablement and suppression of warnings.

To understand how the @code{als} request works, consider two different
storage pools:@: one for objects (macros, strings, etc.), and another
for names.  As soon as an object is defined, GNU @code{troff} adds it to
the object pool, adds its name to the name pool, and creates a link
between them.  When @code{als} creates an alias, it adds a new name to
the name pool that gets linked to the same object as the old name.

Now consider this example.

@Example
.de foo
..
.
.als bar foo
.
.de bar
.  foo
..
.
.bar
    @error{} input stack limit exceeded (probable infinite
    @error{} loop)
@endExample

@noindent
In the above, @code{bar} remains an @emph{alias}---another name
for---the object referred to by @code{foo}, which the second @code{de}
request replaces.  Alternatively, imagine that the @code{de} request
@emph{dereferences} its argument before replacing it.  Either way, the
result of calling @code{bar} is a recursive loop that finally leads to
an error.  @xref{Writing Macros}.

@cindex expressions, conditional
In @code{if}, @code{ie}, and @code{while} requests, in addition to the
numeric expressions described in @ref{Numeric Expressions}, several
Boolean operators are available; the members of this expanded class are
termed @dfn{conditional expressions}.

@table @code
@item c @var{glyph}

@item d @var{name}
True if a string, macro, diversion, or request called @var{name} exists.

@item e
True if the current page is even-numbered.

@item F @var{font}
True if @var{font} exists.  @var{font} is handled as if it were opened
with the @code{ft} request (that is, font translation and styles are
applied), without actually mounting it.

@item m @var{color}
True if @var{color} is defined.

@item n

@item o
True if the current page is odd-numbered.

@item r @var{register}
True if @var{register} exists.

@item S @var{style}
True if @var{style} is available for the current font family.  Font
translation is applied.

@item t
True if the document is being processed in @code{troff} mode.
@xref{@code{troff} and @code{nroff} Modes}.

@item v
Always false.  This condition is recognized only for compatibility with
certain other @code{troff} implementations.@footnote{This refers to
@code{vtroff}, a translator that would convert the C/A/T output from
early-vintage @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} to a form suitable for
Versatec and Benson-Varian plotters.}

@cindex output comparison operator
@item @code{'}@var{xxx}@code{'}@var{yyy}@code{'}
True if formatting the comparands @var{xxx} and @var{yyy} produces the
same output commands.  Other delimiters can be used in place of the
neutral apostrophes (@pxref{Escape Sequences}).  This @dfn{output
comparison operator} formats @var{xxx} and @var{yyy} in separate
environments; after the comparison, the resulting data are discarded.

@Example
.ie "|"\fR|\fP" \
true
.el \
false
    @result{} true
@endExample

@noindent
The resulting glyph properties, including font family, style, size, and
slant, must match, but not necessarily the requests and/or escape
sequences used to obtain them.  In the previous example, @samp{|} and
@samp{\fR|\fP} result in @samp{|} glyphs in the same typefaces at the
same positions, so the comparands are equal.  If @samp{.ft@tie{}I} had
been added before the @samp{.ie}, they would differ: the first @samp{|}
would produce an italic @samp{|}, not a roman one.  Motions must match
in orientation and magnitude to within the applicable horizontal or
vertical resolution of the device, after rounding.  @samp{.if
"\u\d"\v'0'"} is false even though both comparands result in zero net
motion, because motions are not interpreted or optimized but sent as-is
to the output.@footnote{Because formatting of the comparands takes place
in a dummy environment, vertical motions within them cannot spring
traps.}  On the other hand, @samp{.if "\d"\v'0.5m'"} is true, because
@code{\d} is defined as a downward motion of one-half em.@footnote{All
of this is to say that the lists of output nodes created by formatting
@var{xxx} and @var{yyy} must be identical.  @xref{Gtroff Internals}.}

@cindex string comparison
@cindex comparison of strings
Surround the comparands with @code{\?} to avoid formatting them; this
causes them to be compared character by character, as with string
comparisons in other programming languages.

@Example
.ie "\?|\?"\?\fR|\fP\?" \
true
.el \
false
    @result{} false
@endExample

@cindex @code{\?}, and copy mode
@cindex copy mode, and @code{\?}
@cindex mode, copy, and @code{\?}
@noindent
Since comparands protected with @code{\?} are read in copy mode, they
need not even be valid @code{groff} syntax.  The escape character is
still lexically recognized, however, and consumes the next character.

@Example
.ds a \[
.ds b \[
.if '\?\*a\?'\?\*b\?' a and b true
.if '\?\\?'\?\\?' backslash true \" doesn't work
    @result{} a and b true
@c slack lines for pagination control
@c    @error{} warning: missing closing delimiter in
@c    @error{} conditional expression (got newline)
@endExample
@end table

The above operators can't be combined with most others, but a leading
@samp{!}, not followed immediately by spaces or tabs, complements an
expression.

@Example
.nr x 1
.ie !r x register x is not defined
.el      register x is defined
    @result{} register x is defined
@endExample

Spaces and tabs are optional immediately after the @samp{c}, @samp{d},
@samp{F}, @samp{m}, @samp{r}, and @samp{S} operators, but right after
@samp{!}, they end the predicate and the conditional evaluates
true.@footnote{This bizarre behavior maintains compatibility with
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.}

@Example
.nr x 1
.ie ! r x register x is not defined
.el       register x is defined
    @result{} r x register x is not defined
@endExample

@noindent
The unexpected @samp{r x} in the output is a clue that our conditional
was not interpreted as we planned, but matters may not always be so
obvious.

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node if-then, if-else, Operators in Conditionals, Conditionals and Loops
@subsection if-then
@cindex if-then

@Defreq {if, cond-expr anything}
Evaluate the conditional expression @var{cond-expr}, and if it evaluates
true (or to a positive value), interpret the remainder of the line
@var{anything} as if it were an input line.  Recall from @ref{Request
and Macro Arguments} that any quantity of spaces between arguments to
requests serves only to separate them; leading spaces in @var{anything}
are thus not seen.  @var{anything} effectively @emph{cannot} be omitted;
if @var{cond-expr} is true and @var{anything} is empty, the newline at
the end of the control line is interpreted as a blank input line (and
therefore a blank text line).

@Example
super\c
tanker
.nr force-word-break 1
super\c
.if ((\n[force-word-break] = 1) & \n[.int])
tanker
    @result{} supertanker super tanker
@endExample
@endDefreq

@Defreq {nop, anything}
Interpret @var{anything} as if it were an input line.  This is similar
to @samp{.if@tie{}1}.  @code{nop} is not really ``no operation''; its
argument @emph{is} processed---unconditionally.  It can be used to cause
text lines to share indentation with surrounding control lines.

@Example
.als real-MAC MAC
.de wrapped-MAC
.  tm MAC: called with arguments \\$@@
.  nop \\*[real-MAC]\\
..
.als MAC wrapped-MAC
\# Later...
.als MAC real-MAC
@endExample

In the above, we've used aliasing, @code{nop}, and the interpolation of
a macro as a string to interpose a wrapper around the macro @samp{MAC}
(perhaps to debug it).
@endDefreq

@c ---------------------------------------------------------------------

@node if-else, while, Operators in Conditionals, Conditionals and Loops
@subsection if-else
@cindex if-else

@DefreqList {ie, cond-expr anything}
@DefreqListEndx {el, anything}
Use the @code{ie} and @code{el} requests to write an if-then-else.  The
first request is the ``if'' part and the latter is the ``else'' part.
Unusually among programming languages, any number of non-conditional
requests may be interposed between the @code{ie} branch and the
@code{el} branch.

@Example
.nr a 0
.ie \na a is nonzero.
.nr a +1
.el a was not positive but is now \na.
    @result{} a was not positive but is now 1.
@endExample

Another way in which @code{el} is an ordinary request is that it does
not lexically ``bind'' more tightly to its @code{ie} counterpart than it
does to any other request.  This fact can surprise C programmers.

@Example
.nr a 1
.nr z 0
.ie \nz \
.  ie \na a is true
.  el     a is false
.el z is false
    @error{} warning: unbalanced 'el' request
    @result{} a is false

@cindex brace escape sequence, opening (@code{\@})}
@cindex brace escape sequence, closing (@code{\@})}
It is frequently desirable for a control structure to govern more than
one request, call more than one macro, span more than one input line of
text, or mix the foregoing.  The opening and closing brace escape
sequences @code{\@{} and @code{\@}} perform such grouping; such
@dfn{conditional blocks} can be nested.  Brace escape sequences outside
of control structures have no meaning and produce no output.

@code{\@{} should appear (after optional spaces and tabs) immediately
subsequent to the request's conditional expression.  @code{\@}} should
appear on a line with other occurrences of itself as necessary to match
@code{\@{} sequences.  It can be preceded by a control character,
spaces, and tabs.  Input after any quantity of @code{\@}} sequence on
the same line is processed only if all of the preceding conditions to
which they correspond are true.  Furthermore, a @code{\@}} closing the
body of a @code{while} request (discussed below) must be the last such
escape sequence on an input line.

@Example
A
.if 0 \@{ B
C
D
\@}E
F
    @result{} A F
@endExample

@Example
N
.if 1 \@{ O
.  if 0 \@{ P
Q
R\@} S\@} T
U
    @result{} N O U
@endExample

The above behavior may challenge the intuition; it was implemented to
retain compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.  For clarity, it
is idiomatic to end input lines with @code{\@{}, followed by
@code{\@key{RET}} if desired to prevent the newline from being
interpreted as a blank text line, and to precede @code{\@}} on an input
line with nothing more than a control character, spaces, tabs, and other
instances of itself.

@Example
.de DEBUG
debug =
.ie \\$1 \@{\
ON,
development
\@}
.el \@{\
OFF,
production
\@}
version
..
.DEBUG 0
.br
.DEBUG 1
@endExample

Try omitting the @code{\@key{RET}}s from the foregoing example and see
how the output changes.  Remember that, as noted above, after a true
conditional (or after the @code{el} request if its counterpart @code{ie}
condition was false) the remainder of the input line is interpreted
@emph{as if it were on an input line by itself}.
@endDefesc

@node while,  , if-else, Conditionals and Loops
@subsection while
@cindex while

@code{groff} provides a looping construct:@: the @code{while} request.
Its syntax matches the @code{if} request.

@cindex body, of a while request
@Defreq {while, cond-expr anything}
Evaluate the conditional expression @var{cond-expr}, and repeatedly
execute @var{anything} unless and until @var{cond-expr} evaluates false.
@var{anything}, which is often a conditional block, is referred to as
the @code{while} request's @dfn{body}.

@Example
.nr a 0 1
.while (\na < 9) \@{\
\n+a,
.\@}
\n+a
    @result{} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
@endExample

@cindex @code{de} request, and @code{while}
GNU @code{troff} treats the body of a @code{while} request similarly to
that of a @code{de} request (albeit one not read in copy
mode@footnote{@xref{Copy Mode}.}), but stores it under an internal name
and deletes it when it exits.  The operation of a macro containing a
@code{while} request can slow significantly if the @code{while} body is
large.  Each time the macro is executed, the @code{while} body is parsed
and stored again.

@Example
.de xxx
.  nr num 10
.  while (\\n[num] > 0) \@{\
.    \" many lines of code
.    nr num -1
.  \@}
..
@endExample

@cindex recursive macros
@cindex macros, recursive
@noindent
An often better solution---and one that is more portable, since
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} lacked the @code{while} request---is to
instead write a recursive macro.  It will only be parsed
once.@footnote{unless you redefine it}

@Example
.de yyy
.  if (\\n[num] > 0) \@{\
.    \" many lines of code
.    nr num -1
.    yyy
.  \@}
..
.
.de xxx
.  nr num 10
.  yyy
..
@endExample

@noindent
To prevent infinite loops, the default number of available recursion
levels is 1,000 or somewhat less.@footnote{``somewhat less'' because
things other than macro calls can be on the input stack}  You can
disable this protective measure, or raise the limit, by setting the
@code{slimit} register.  @xref{Debugging}.

As noted above, if a @code{while} body begins with a conditional block,
its closing brace must end an input line.

@Example
.if 1 \@{\
.  nr a 0 1
.  while (\n[a] < 10) \@{\
.    nop \n+[a]
.\@}\@}

@cindex macros, writing

A @dfn{macro} is a stored collection of text and control lines that can
be interpolated multiple times.  Use macros to define common operations.
Macros are called in the same way that requests are invoked.
@xref{Strings}, for a (limited) alternative syntax to call macros.
While requests exist for the purpose of creating macros, simply calling
an undefined macro, or interpolating it as a string, will cause it to be
defined as empty.  @xref{Identifiers}.

@Defreq {de, name [@Var{end}]}
Define a macro @var{name}, replacing the definition of any existing
request, macro, string, or diversion called @var{name}.  GNU
@code{troff} enters ``copy mode'', storing subsequent input lines as the
macro definition.  If the optional second argument is not specified, the
definition ends with the control line @samp{..} (two dots).
Alternatively, @var{end} identifies a macro whose call syntax at the
start of a control line ends the definition of @var{name}; @var{end} is
then called normally.  A macro definition must end in the same
conditional block (if any) in which it began.@footnote{@xref{Conditional
Blocks}}  Spaces or tabs are permitted after the control character in
the line containing this ending token (either @samp{.} or
@samp{@var{end}}), but a tab immediately after the token prevents its
recognition as the end of a macro definition.  The macro @var{end} can
be called with arguments.@footnote{While it is possible to define and
call a macro @samp{.}, you can't use it as an end macro: during a macro
definition, @samp{..} is never handled as calling @samp{.}, even if
@samp{.de @var{name} .} explicitly precedes it.}
@c
@c @Example
@c .de .
@c (dot macro)
@c ..
@c .
@c ..    \" This calls macro '.'!
@c .de m1 .
@c (m1 macro)
@c ..    \" This does not.
@c .m1
@c     @result{} (dot macro) (m1 macro)
@c @endExample

Here is a small example macro called @samp{P} that causes a break and
inserts some vertical space.  It could be used to separate paragraphs.

@Example
.de P
.  br
.  sp .8v
..
@endExample

We can define one macro within another.  Attempting to nest @samp{..}
navely will end the outer definition because the inner definition
isn't interpreted as such until the outer macro is later interpolated.
We can use an end macro instead.  Each level of nesting should use a
unique end macro.

An end macro need not be defined until it is called.  This fact enables
a nested macro definition to begin inside one macro and end inside
another.  Consider the following example.@footnote{The structure of this
example is adapted from, and isomorphic to, part of a solution by Tadziu
Hoffman to the problem of reflowing text multiple times to find an
optimal configuration for it.
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2008-12/msg00006.html}}

@Example
.de m1
.  de m2 m3
you
..
.de m3
Hello,
Joe.
..
.de m4
do
..
.m1
know?
.  m3
What
.m4
.m2
    @result{} Hello, Joe.  What do you know?
@endExample

@noindent
A nested macro definition @emph{can} be terminated with @samp{..} and
nested macros @emph{can} reuse end macros, but these control lines must
be escaped multiple times for each level of nesting.  The necessity of
this escaping and the utility of nested macro definitions will become
clearer when we employ macro parameters and consider the behavior of
copy mode in detail.
@endDefreq

@code{de} defines a macro that inherits the compatibility mode
enablement status of its context (@pxref{Implementation Differences}).
Often it is desirable to make a macro that uses @code{groff} features
callable from contexts where compatibility mode is on; for instance,
when writing extensions to a historical macro package.  To achieve this,
compatibility mode needs to be switched off while such a macro is
interpreted---without disturbing that state when it is finished.

@Defreq {de1, name [@Var{end}]}
The @code{de1} request defines a macro to be interpreted with
compatibility mode disabled.  When @var{name} is called, compatibility
mode enablement status is saved, and when @var{name} finishes, it is
restored.  Observe the extra backlash before the interpolation of
register @samp{xxx}; we'll explore this subject in @ref{Copy Mode}.

@Example
.nr xxx 12345
.de aa
The value of xxx is \\n[xxx].
.  br
..
.de1 bb
The value of xxx is \\n[xxx].
..
.cp 1
.aa
    @error{} warning: register '[' not defined
    @result{} The value of xxx is 0xxx].
.bb
    @result{} The value of xxx is 12345.
@endExample
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {dei, name [@Var{end}]}
@DefreqListEndx {dei1, name [@Var{end}]}
The @code{dei} request defines a macro with its name and end
macro indirected through strings.  That is, it interpolates strings
named @var{name} and @var{end} before performing the definition.

The following examples are equivalent.

@Example
.ds xx aa
.ds yy bb
.dei xx yy
@endExample

@Example
.de aa bb
@endExample

The @code{dei1} request bears the same relationship to @code{dei} as
@code{de1} does to @code{de}; it temporarily turns compatibility mode
off when @var{name} is called.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {am, name [@Var{end}]}
@DefreqItemx {am1, name [@Var{end}]}
@DefreqItemx {ami, name [@Var{end}]}
@DefreqListEndx {ami1, name [@Var{end}]}
@cindex appending to a macro (@code{am})
@cindex macro, appending to (@code{am})
@code{am} appends subsequent input lines to macro @var{name}, extending
its definition, and otherwise working as @code{de} does.

To make the previously defined @samp{P} macro set indented instead of
block paragraphs, add the necessary code to the existing macro.

@Example
.am P
.ti +5n
..
@endExample

The other requests are analogous to their @samp{de} counterparts.  The
@code{am1} request turns off compatibility mode during interpretation of
the appendment.  The @code{ami} request appends indirectly, meaning that
strings @var{name} and @var{end} are interpolated with the resulting
names used before appending.  The @code{ami1} request is similar to
@code{ami}, disabling compatibility mode during interpretation of the
appended lines.
@endDefreq

@pindex trace.tmac
Using @file{trace.tmac}, you can trace calls to @code{de},
@code{de1}, @code{am}, and @code{am1}.  You can also use the
@code{backtrace} request at any point desired to troubleshoot tricky
spots (@pxref{Debugging}).

@cindex object creation
Macro identifiers share their name space with requests, strings, and
diversions; see @ref{Identifiers}.  The @code{am}, @code{as}, @code{da},
@code{de}, @code{di}, and @code{ds} requests (together with their
variants) create a new object only if the name of the macro, diversion,
or string is currently undefined or if it is defined as a request;
normally, they modify the value of an existing object.  @xref{als,,the
description of the @code{als} request}, for pitfalls when redefining a
macro that is aliased.

@Defreq {return, [@Var{anything}]}
Exit a macro, immediately returning to the caller.  If called with an
argument @var{anything}, exit twice---the current macro and the macro
one level higher.  This is used to define a wrapper macro for
@code{return} in @file{trace.tmac}.

@node Parameters, Copy Mode, Writing Macros, Writing Macros
@subsection Parameters
@cindex parameters

Macro calls and string interpolations optionally accept a list of
arguments; recall @ref{Request and Macro Arguments}.  At the time such
an interpolation takes place, these @dfn{parameters} can be examined
using a register and a variety of escape sequences starting with
@samp{\$}.  All such escape sequences are interpreted even in copy mode,
a fact we shall motivate and explain below (@pxref{Copy Mode}).

@Defreg {.$}
@cindex parameter count register (@code{.$})
The count of parameters available to a macro or string is kept in this
read-only register.  The @code{shift} request can change its value.
@endDefreg

Any individual parameter can be accessed by its position in the list of
arguments to the macro call, numbered from left to right starting at 1,
with one of the following escape sequences.

@DefescList {\\$, , n, }
@DefescItem {\\$, (, nn, }
@DefescListEnd {\\$, [, nnn, ]}
Interpolate the @var{n}th, @var{nn}th, or @var{nnn}th parameter.  The
first form expects only a single digit (1@leq{}@var{n}@leq{}9)), the
second two digits (01@leq{}@var{nn}@leq{}99)), and the third any
positive integer @var{nnn}.  Macros and strings accept an unlimited
number of parameters.
@endDefesc

@Defreq {shift, [@Var{n}]}
Shift the parameters @var{n} places (1@tie{}by default).  This is a
``left shift'': what was parameter@tie{}@var{i} becomes parameter
@math{@var{i}-@var{n}}.  The parameters formerly in positions 1
to@tie{}@var{n} are no longer available.  Shifting by a nonpositive
amount performs no operation.  The register @code{.$} is adjusted
accordingly.
@endDefreq

@cindex copy mode, and macro parameters
@cindex mode, copy, and macro parameters
@cindex macro, parameters (@code{\$})
@cindex parameters, macro (@code{\$})
In practice, parameter interpolations are usually seen prefixed with an
extra escape character.  This is because the @code{\$} family of escape
sequences is interpreted even in copy mode.@footnote{If they were not,
parameter interpolations would be similar to command-line
parameters---fixed for the entire duration of a @code{roff} program's
run.  The advantage of interpolating @code{\$} escape sequences even in
copy mode is that they can change from one interpolation to the next,
like function parameters.  The additional escape character is the price
of this power.}

@DefescList {\\$*, , , }
@DefescItemx {\\$@@, , , }
@DefescListEndx {\\$^, , , }
In some cases it is convenient to interpolate all of the parameters at
once (to pass them to a request, for instance).  The @code{\$*} escape
concatenates the parameters, separating them with spaces.  @code{\$@@}
is similar, concatenating the parameters, surrounding each with double
quotes and separating them with spaces.  If not in compatibility mode,
the interpolation depth of double quotes is preserved (@pxref{Request
and Macro Arguments}).  @code{\$^} interpolates all parameters as if
they were arguments to the @code{ds} request.

@Example
.de foo
. tm $1='\\$1'
. tm $2='\\$2'
. tm $*='\\$*'
. tm $@@='\\$@@'
. tm $^='\\$^'
..
.foo " This is a "test"
    @error{} $1=' This is a '
    @error{} $2='test"'
    @error{} $*=' This is a  test"'
    @error{} $@@='" This is a " "test""'
    @error{} $^='" This is a "test"'
@endExample

@code{\$*} is useful when writing a macro that doesn't need to
distinguish its arguments, or even to not interpret them; examples
include macros that produce diagnostic messages by wrapping the
@code{tm} or @code{ab} requests.  Use @code{\$@@} when writing a macro
that may need to shift its parameters and/or wrap a macro or request
that finds the count significant.  If in doubt, prefer @code{\$@@} to
@code{\$*}.  An application of @code{\$^} is seen in @file{trace.tmac},
which redefines some requests and macros for debugging purposes.
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\$0, , , }
@cindex macro name register (@code{\$0})
@cindex @code{als} request, and @code{\$0}
Interpolate the name by which the macro being interpreted was called.
The @code{als} request can cause a macro to have more than one name.
Applying string interpolation to a macro does not change this name.

@Example
.de foo
.  tm \\$0
..
.als bar foo
.
.de aaa
.  foo
..
.de bbb
.  bar
..
.de ccc
\\*[foo]\\

@cindex @code{\n}, when reading text for a macro
@cindex @code{\$}, when reading text for a macro
@cindex @code{\*}, when reading text for a macro
@cindex \@key{RET}, when reading text for a macro
When GNU @code{troff} processes certain requests, most importantly those
which define or append to a macro or string, it does so in @dfn{copy
mode}: it copies the characters of the definition into a dedicated
storage region, interpolating the escape sequences @code{\n}, @code{\g},
@code{\$}, @code{\*}, and @code{\V} normally; interpreting
@code{\@key{RET}} immediately; discarding comments @code{\"} and
@code{\#}; interpolating the current leader, escape, or tab character
with @code{\a}, @code{\e}, and @code{\t}, respectively; and storing all
other escape sequences in an encoded form.

@cindex interpretation mode
@cindex mode, interpretation
The complement of copy mode---a @code{roff} formatter's behavior when
not defining or appending to a macro, string, or diversion---where all
macros are interpolated, requests invoked, and valid escape sequences
processed immediately upon recognition, can be termed
@dfn{interpretation mode}.

@Defesc {\\\\, , , }
The escape character, @code{\} by default, can escape a backslash.  This
enables you to control whether a given @code{\n}, @code{\g}, @code{\$},
@code{\*}, or @code{\V} escape sequence is interpreted at the time the
macro containing it is defined, or later when the macro is
called.@footnote{Compare this to the @code{\def} and @code{\edef}
commands in @TeX{}.}

@Example
.nr x 20
.de y
.nr x 10
\&\nx
\&\\nx
..
.y
    @result{} 20 10
@endExample

You can think of @code{\\} as a ``delayed'' backslash; it is the escape
character followed by a backslash from which the escape character has
removed its special meaning.  Consequently, @samp{\\} is not an escape
sequence in the usual sense.  In any escape sequence @samp{\@var{X}}
that GNU @code{troff} does not recognize, the escape character is
ignored and @var{X} is output, with two exceptions---@samp{\\} is the
first.
@endDefesc

@cindex @code{\\}, when reading text for a macro
@Defesc {\\., , , }
@code{\.} escapes the control character.  It is similar to @code{\\} in
that it isn't a true escape sequence.  It is used to permit nested macro
definitions to end without a named macro call to conclude them.  Without
a syntax for escaping the control character, this would not be possible.

@Example
.de m1
foo
.
.  de m2
bar
\\..
.
..
.m1
.m2
    @result{} foo bar
@endExample

@noindent
The first backslash is consumed while the macro is read, and the second
is interpreted when macro @code{m1} is called.
@endDefesc

@code{roff} documents should not use the @code{\\} or @code{\.}
tokens outside of copy mode; they serve only to obfuscate the input.
Use @code{\e} to represent the escape character, @code{\[rs]} to obtain
a backslash glyph, and @code{\&} before @samp{.} and @samp{'} where GNU
@code{troff} expects them as control characters if you mean to use them
literally (recall @ref{Requests and Macros}).

Macro definitions can be nested to arbitrary depth.  The mechanics of
parsing the escape character have significant consequences for this
practice.

@Example
.de M1
\\$1
.  de M2
\\\\$1
.    de M3
\\\\\\\\$1
\\\\..
.    M3 hand.
\\..
.  M2 of
..
This understeer is getting
.M1 out
    @result{} This understeer is getting out of hand.
@endExample

Each escape character is interpreted twice---once in copy mode, when the
macro is defined, and once outside of it, when the macro is called.  As
seen above, this fact leads to exponential growth in the quantity of
escape characters required to delay interpolation of @code{\n},
@code{\g}, @code{\$}, @code{\*}, and @code{\V} at each nesting level,
which can be daunting.  GNU @code{troff} offers a solution.

@Defesc {\\E, , , }
@code{\E} represents an escape character that is not interpreted in copy
mode.  You can use it to ease the writing of nested macro definitions.

@Example
.de M1
.  nop \E$1
.  de M2
.    nop \E$1
.    de M3
.      nop \E$1
\\\\..
.    M3 better.
\\..
.  M2 bit
..
This vehicle handles
.M1 a
    @result{} This vehicle handles a bit better.
@endExample

Observe that because @code{\.} is not a true escape sequence, we can't
use @code{\E} to keep @samp{..} from ending a macro definition
prematurely.  If the multiplicity of backslashes complicates
maintenance, use end macros.

@code{\E} is also convenient to define strings containing escape
sequences that need to work when used in copy mode (for example, as
macro arguments), or which will be interpolated at varying macro nesting
depths.  We might define strings to begin and end superscripting
as follows.@footnote{These are lightly adapted from the @code{groff}
implementation of the @file{ms} macros.}

@Example
.ds @{ \v'-.9m\s'\En[.s]*7u/10u'+.7m'
.ds @} \v'-.7m\s0+.9m'
@endExample

When the @code{ec} request is used to redefine the escape character,
@code{\E} also makes it easier to distinguish the semantics of an escape
character from the other meaning(s) its character might have.  Consider
the use of an unusual escape character, @samp{-}.

@Example
.nr a 1
.ec -
.de xx
--na
..
.xx
    @result{} -na
@endExample

@noindent
This result may surprise you; some people expect @samp{1} to be output
since register @samp{a} has clearly been defined with that value.  What
has happened?  The robotic replacement of @samp{\} with @samp{-} has led
us astray.  You might recognize the sequence @samp{--} more readily with
the default escape character as @samp{\-}, the special character escape
sequence for the minus sign glyph.

@Example
.nr a 1
.ec -
.de xx
-Ena
..
.xx
    @result{} 1

@xref{Manipulating Spacing}, for a discussion of the most commonly used
request for vertical motion, @code{sp}, which spaces downward by one
vee.

@DefreqListEndx {rt, [@Var{dist}]}
@cindex marking vertical page location (@code{mk})
@cindex page location, vertical, marking (@code{mk})
@cindex location, vertical, page, marking (@code{mk})
@cindex vertical page location, marking (@code{mk})
@cindex returning to marked vertical page location (@code{rt})
@cindex page location, vertical, returning to marked (@code{rt})
@cindex location, vertical, page, returning to marked (@code{rt})
@cindex vertical page location, returning to marked (@code{rt})
You can @dfn{mark} a location on a page for subsequent @dfn{return}.
@code{mk} takes an argument, a register name in which to store the
current page location.  If given no argument, it stores the location in
an internal register.  This location can be used later by the @code{rt}
or the @code{sp} requests (or the @code{\v} escape).

The @code{rt} request returns @emph{upward} to the location marked with
the last @code{mk} request.  If used with an argument, it returns to a
vertical position@tie{}@var{dist} from the top of the page (no previous
call to @code{mk} is necessary in this case).  The default scaling
indicator is @samp{v}.

If a page break occurs between a @code{mk} request and its matching
@code{rt} request, the @code{rt} request is silently ignored.

A simple implementation of a macro to set text in two columns follows.

@Example
.nr column-length 1.5i
.nr column-gap 4m
.nr bottom-margin 1m
.
.de 2c
.  br
.  mk
.  ll \\n[column-length]u

.  nr right-side 0
..
.
.de 2c-trap
.  ie \\n[right-side] \@{\
.    nr right-side 0
.    po -(\\n[column-length]u + \\n[column-gap]u)
.    \" remove trap
.    wh -\\n[bottom-margin]u
.  \@}
.  el \@{\
.    \" switch to right side
.    nr right-side 1
.    po +(\\n[column-length]u + \\n[column-gap]u)
.    rt
.  \@}
..
@endExample

Now let us apply our two-column macro.

@Example
.pl 1.5i
.ll 4i
This is a small test that shows how the
rt request works in combination with mk.

.2c
Starting here, text is typeset in two columns.
Note that this implementation isn't robust
and thus not suited for a real two-column
macro.
    @result{} This is a small test that shows how the
    @result{} rt request works in combination with mk.
    @result{}
    @result{} Starting  here,    isn't    robust

@endExample
@endDefreq

Several escape sequences enable fine control of movement about the page.

@Defesc {\\v, @code{'}, expr, @code{'}}
@cindex vertical motion (@code{\v})
@cindex motion, vertical (@code{\v})
Move vertically relative to the drawing position.@footnote{unless the
boundary-relative motion operator @samp{|} is used---see @ref{Numeric
Expressions})}  @var{expr} indicates the magnitude of motion: positive
is downward and and negative upward.  The default scaling unit is
@samp{v}.  Beware, however, that GNU @code{troff} continues text
processing at the point where the motion ends, so you should always
balance motions to avoid interference with text processing.

@code{\v} doesn't trigger a trap.  This can be useful; for example,
consider a page bottom trap macro that prints a marker in the margin to
indicate continuation of a footnote or something similar.
@endDefesc

A few escape sequences that produce vertical motion are unusual.  They
are thought to originate early in AT&T @code{nroff} history to achieve
super- and sub-scripting by half-line motions on line printers and
teletypewriters before the phototypesetter made more precise positioning
available.  They are reckoned in ems---not vees---to maintain continuity
with their original purpose of moving relative to the size of the type
rather than the distance between text baselines (vees).@footnote{At the
@code{grops} defaults of 10-point type on 12-point vertical spacing, the
difference between half a vee and half an em can be subtle: large
spacings like @samp{.vs 3v} make it obvious.}

@DefescList {\\r, , , }
@DefescItemx {\\u, , , }
@DefescListEndx {\\d, , , }
Move upward@tie{}1@dmn{m}, upward@tie{}.5@dmn{m}, and
downward@tie{}.5@dmn{m}, respectively.
@endDefesc

@noindent
Let us see these escape sequences in use.

@Example
Obtain 100 cm\u3\d of \ka\d\092\h'|\nau'\r233\dU.
@endExample

In the foregoing we have paired @code{\u} and @code{\d} to place a
subscript, then used a full em negative (``reverse'') motion to place a
superscript above a subscript.  An unbreakable digit-width space escape
sequence aligns the proton and nucleon numbers, while @code{\k} marks a
horizontal position to which @code{\h} returns so that we could stack
them.  (We shall discuss these horizontal motion escape sequences
presently.)  In serious applications, we often want to alter the type
size of the -scripts and to fine-tune the vertical motions, as the
@code{groff} @file{ms} package does with its super- and subscripting
string definitions.

@Defesc {\\h, @code{'}, expr, @code{'}}
@cindex inserting horizontal space (@code{\h})
@cindex horizontal space (@code{\h})
@cindex space, horizontal (@code{\h})
@cindex horizontal motion (@code{\h})
@cindex motion, horizontal (@code{\h})
Move horizontally relative to the drawing postition.@footnote{unless the
boundary-relative motion operator @samp{|} is used---see @ref{Numeric
Expressions})}  @var{expr} indicates the magnitude of motion: positive
is rightward and negative leftward.  The default scaling unit is
@samp{m}.

This horizontal space is not discarded at the end of a line.  To insert
discardable space of a certain length, use the @code{ss} request.
@endDefesc

The following string definition sets the @TeX{}
logo.@footnote{@xref{Strings}, for an explanation of the trailing
@samp{\"}.}

@Example
.ds TeX T\h'-.1667m'\v'.224m'E\v'-.224m'\h'-.125m'X\"
@endExample

There are a number of special-case escape sequences for horizontal
motion.

@Defesc {\\@key{SP}, , , }
@cindex space, unbreakable
@cindex unbreakable space
An unbreakable, non-adjustable space.  (This is a backslash followed by
a space.)  Usually you want one of the following escape sequences
instead, often @code{\~}.
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\~, , , }
An unbreakable space that is adjustable like a normal inter-word space.
@endDefesc

@cindex thin space
@cindex space, thin
@Defesc {\\|, , , }
An unbreakable one-sixth @dmn{em} (``thin'') space.  Ignored (rounded to
zero width) on terminal output devices.  However, if there is a glyph
defined in the current font with name @code{\|} (note the leading
backslash), the width of this glyph is used instead (even on terminals).
@endDefesc

@cindex hair space
@cindex space, hair
@Defesc {\\^, , , }
An unbreakable one-twelfth @dmn{em} (``hair'') space.  Ignored (rounded
to zero width) on terminal output devices.  However, if there is a glyph
defined in the current font with name @code{\^} (note the leading
backslash), the width of this glyph is used instead (even on terminals).
@endDefesc

@Defesc {\\0, , , }
@cindex space, width of a digit (numeral) (@code{\0})

@cindex dummy environment, used by @code{\w} escape sequence
@cindex environment, dummy, used by @code{\w} escape sequence
The @var{text} argument to @code{\w} is processed in a dummy

surrounding output.

After use, @code{\w} sets several registers.

@table @code
@item st
@itemx sb
The highest and lowest point of the baseline, respectively, in
@var{text}.

@item rst
@itemx rsb
Like the @code{st} and @code{sb} registers, but takes account of the
heights and depths of glyphs.  In other words, this gives the highest
and lowest point of @var{text}.  Values below the baseline are negative.

@item ct
Defines the kinds of glyphs occurring in @var{text}:

@table @asis
@item 0
only short glyphs, no descenders or tall glyphs.

@item 1
at least one descender.

@item 2
at least one tall glyph.

@item 3
at least one each of a descender and a tall glyph.
@end table

@item ssc
The amount of horizontal space (possibly negative) that should be added
to the last glyph before a subscript.

@item skw
How far to right of the center of the last glyph in the @code{\w}
argument, the center of an accent from a roman font should be placed

@section Drawing Requests
@cindex drawing requests
@cindex requests for drawing

@code{gtroff} provides a number of ways to draw lines and other figures
on the page.  Used in combination with the page motion commands
(@pxref{Page Motions}), a wide variety of figures can be drawn.
However, for complex drawings these operations can be quite cumbersome,
and it may be wise to use graphic preprocessors like @code{gpic} or
@code{ggrn}.  @xref{gpic}, and @ref{ggrn}.

All drawing is done via escape sequences.

@DefescList {\\l, @code{'}, l, @code{'}}
@DefescListEnd {\\l, @code{'}, lg, @code{'}}
@cindex drawing horizontal lines (@code{\l})
@cindex horizontal line, drawing (@code{\l})
@cindex line, horizontal, drawing (@code{\l})
Draw a line horizontally.  @var{l} is the length of the line to be
drawn.  If it is positive, start the line at the current location and
draw to the right; its end point is the new current location.  Negative
values are handled differently: The line starts at the current location
and draws to the left, but the current location doesn't move.

@var{l} can also be specified absolutely (i.e., with a leading
@samp{|}), which draws back to the beginning of the input line.  Default
scaling indicator is @samp{m}.

@cindex underscore glyph (@code{\[ru]})
@cindex glyph, underscore (@code{\[ru]})
@cindex line drawing glyph
@cindex glyph, for line drawing
The optional second parameter@tie{}@var{g} is a glyph to draw the line
with.  If this second argument is not specified, @code{gtroff} uses the
underscore glyph, @code{\[ru]}.

@cindex non-printing input break (@code{\&}), effect on @code{\l} escape
@cindex input break, non-printing (@code{\&}), effect on @code{\l} escape
@cindex break, non-printing input (@code{\&}), effect on @code{\l} escape
To separate the two arguments (to prevent @code{gtroff} from
interpreting a drawing glyph as a scaling indicator if the glyph is
represented by a single character) use @code{\&}.

@Example
.de textbox
\[br]\\$*\[br]\l'|0\[rn]'\l'|0\[ul]'
..
@endExample

@noindent
The above works by outputting a box rule (a vertical line), then the
text given as an argument and then another box rule.  Finally, the
line-drawing escape sequences both draw from the current location to the
beginning of the @emph{input} line---this works because the line length
is negative, not moving the current point.

Draw vertical lines.  Its parameters are similar to the @code{\l}

movement is downward for positive values, and upward for negative
values.  The default glyph is the box rule glyph, @code{\[br]}.  As with

The @code{\D} escape provides a variety of drawing functions.  On
character devices, only vertical and horizontal lines are supported
within @code{grotty}; other devices may only support a subset of the
available drawing functions.

The default scaling indicator for all subcommands of @code{\D} is
@samp{m} for horizontal distances and @samp{v} for vertical ones.
Exceptions are @samp{\D'f @dots{}'} and @samp{\D't @dots{}'}, which use
@code{u} as the default, and @samp{\D'F@var{x} @dots{}'}, which
arguments are treated similar to the @code{defcolor} request.

@item \D'l @var{dx} @var{dy}'
@cindex line, drawing (@samp{\D'l @dots{}'})
@cindex drawing a line (@samp{\D'l @dots{}'})
Draw a line from the current location to the relative point specified by
(@var{dx},@var{dy}), where positive values mean right and down,
respectively.  The end point of the line is the new current location.

The following example is a macro for creating a box around a text
string; for simplicity, the box margin is taken as a fixed value,
0.2@dmn{m}.

@noindent
First, the width of the string is stored in register @code{@@wd}.  Then,
four lines are drawn to form a box, properly offset by the box margin.
The registers @code{rst} and @code{rsb} are set by the @code{\w} escape,
containing the largest height and depth of the whole string.

Draw an arc clockwise from the current location through the two
specified relative locations (@var{dx1},@var{dy1}) and
(@var{dx2},@var{dy2}).  The coordinates of the first point are relative
to the current position, and the coordinates of the second point are
relative to the first point.  After drawing, the current position is
moved to the final point of the arc.

current position is moved to the terminal point of the drawn curve.

@item \D'f @var{n}'
@cindex gray shading (@samp{\D'f @dots{}'})
@cindex shading filled objects (@samp{\D'f @dots{}'})
Set the shade of gray to be used for filling solid objects
to@tie{}@var{n}; @var{n}@tie{}must be an integer between 0
and@tie{}1000, where 0 corresponds solid white and 1000 to solid black,
and values in between correspond to intermediate shades of gray.  This
applies only to solid circles, solid ellipses, and solid polygons.  By
default, a level of 1000 is used.

Nonintuitively, the current point is moved horizontally to the
right by@tie{}@var{n}.

@cindex @samp{\D'f @dots{}'} and horizontal resolution
Don't use this command!  It has the serious drawback that it is always
rounded to the next integer multiple of the horizontal resolution (the
value of the @code{hor} keyword in the @file{DESC} file).  Use @code{\M}
(@pxref{Colors}) or @samp{\D'Fg @dots{}'} instead.

@cindex polygon, drawing (@samp{\D'p @dots{}'})
Draw a polygon from the current location to the relative position
(@var{dx1},@var{dy1}) and then to (@var{dx2},@var{dy2}) and so on.  When
the specified data points are exhausted, a line is drawn back to the
starting point.  The current position is changed by adding the sum of
all arguments with odd index to the actual horizontal position and the
even ones to the vertical position.

@item \D'P @var{dx1} @var{dy1} @var{dx2} @var{dy2} @dots{}'

@cindex solid polygon, drawing (@samp{\D'P @dots{}'})
Draw a solid polygon with the same parameters and behaviour as an
outlined polygon.  No outline is drawn.

Here a better variant of the box macro to fill the box with some color.
The box must be drawn before the text since colors in GNU @code{troff}
are not transparent; the filled polygon would hide the text completely.

@Example

..
@endExample

If you want a filled polygon that has exactly the same size as an
unfilled one, you must draw both an unfilled and a filled polygon.  A
filled polygon is always smaller than an unfilled one because the latter
uses straight lines with a given line thickness to connect the polygon's
corners, while the former simply fills the area defined by the
coordinates.

@Example
\h'1i'\v'1i'\
\# increase line thickness
\Z'\D't 5p''\
\# draw unfilled polygon
\Z'\D'p 3 3 -6 0''\
\# draw filled polygon

@endExample

@item \D't @var{n}'
@cindex line thickness (@samp{\D't @dots{}'})
@cindex thickness of lines (@samp{\D't @dots{}'})
Set the current line thickness to @var{n}@tie{}basic units.  A value
of zero selects the smallest available line thickness.  A negative value
makes the line thickness proportional to the current type size (this is
the default behaviour of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}).

Nonintuitively, the current point is moved horizontally to the
right by@tie{}@var{n}.

@item \D'F@var{scheme} @var{color_components}'
@cindex unnamed fill colors (@code{\D'F@dots{}'})
@cindex fill colors, unnamed (@code{\D'F@dots{}'})
@cindex colors, fill, unnamed (@code{\D'F@dots{}'})
Change current fill color.  @var{scheme} is a single letter denoting the
color scheme: @samp{r} (rgb), @samp{c} (cmy), @samp{k} (cmyk), @samp{g}
(gray), or @samp{d} (default color).  The color components use exactly
the same syntax as in the @code{defcolor} request (@pxref{Colors}); the
command @code{\D'Fd'} doesn't take an argument.

@node Deferring Output, Traps, Drawing Requests, gtroff Reference
@section Deferring Output
@cindex deferred output

@cindex environment
@cindex diversion
@cindex trap
A few @code{roff} language elements are generally not used in simple
documents, but arise as page layouts become more sophisticated and
demanding.  @dfn{Environments} collect formatting parameters like line
length and typeface.  A @dfn{diversion} stores formatted output for
later use.  A @dfn{trap} is a condition on the input or output, tested
automatically by the formatter, that is associated with a macro, causing
it to be called when that condition is fulfilled.

Footnote support often exercises all three of the foregoing features.  A
simple implementation might work as follows.  A pair of macros is
defined: one starts a footnote and the other ends it.  The author calls
the first macro where a footnote marker is desired.  The macro
establishes a diversion so that the footnote text is collected at the
place in the body text where its corresponding marker appears.  An
environment is created for the footnote so that it is set at a smaller
typeface.  The footnote text is formatted in the diversion using that
environment, but it does not yet appear in the output.  The document
author calls the footnote end macro, which returns to the previous
environment and ends the diversion.  Later, after much more body text in
the document, a trap, set a small distance above the page bottom, is
sprung.  The macro called by the trap draws a line across the page and
emits the stored diversion.  Thus, the footnote is rendered.

Diversions and traps make the text formatting process non-linear.  Let
us imagine a set of text lines or paragraphs labelled @samp{A},
@samp{B}, and so on.  If we set up a trap that produces text @samp{T}
(as a page footer, say), and we also use a diversion to store the
formatted text @samp{D}, then a document with input text in the order
@samp{A B C D E F} might render as @samp{A B C E T F}.  The diversion
@samp{D} will never be output if we do not call for it.

Environments of themselves are not a source of non-linearity in document
formatting:@: environment switches have immediate effect.  One could
always write a macro to change as many formatting parameters as desired
with a single convenient call.  But because diversions can be nested and
macros called by traps that are sprung by other trap-called macros, they
may be called upon in varying contexts.  For example, consider a page
header that is always to be set in Helvetica.  A document that uses
Times for most of its body text, but Courier for displayed code
examples, poses a challenge if a page break occurs in the middle of a
code display; if the header trap assumes that the ``previous font'' is
always Times, the rest of the example will be formatted in the wrong
typeface.  One could carefully save all formatting parameters upon
entering the trap and restore them upon leaving it, but this is verbose,
error-prone, and not future-proof as the @code{groff} language develops.
Environments save us considerable effort.

@dfn{Traps} are locations in the output or conditions on the input that,
when reached or fulfilled, cause a specified macro to be called.  These
traps can occur at a given location on the page, at a given location in
the current diversion (together, these are known as @emph{vertical
position traps}), at a blank line, at a line with leading space
characters, after a given quantity of input lines, or at the end of
input.  Macros called by traps have no arguments.

@cindex traps, vertical position

@dfn{Vertical position traps} perform an action when GNU @code{troff}
reaches or passes a certain vertical location on the output page or in a
diversion.  Their applications include setting page headers and footers,
body text in multiple columns, and footnotes.

@noindent
The location parameter used in vertical position traps has a default
scaling unit of @samp{v}, and its value is rounded to a multiple of the
vertical resolution (found in the register @code{.V}).

@DefreqList {vpt, [@Var{flag}]}
@DefregListEndx {.vpt}
@cindex enabling vertical position traps (@code{vpt})
@cindex vertical position traps, enabling (@code{vpt})
@cindex vertical position trap enable register (@code{.vpt})
Enable vertical position traps if @var{flag} is non-zero or absent;
disable them otherwise.  Vertical position traps are those set by the
@code{wh} request or by @code{dt} within a diversion.  The parameter
that controls whether vertical position traps are enabled is global.
Initially, vertical position traps are enabled.  The current value is
stored in the @code{.vpt} read-only register.

A page can't be ejected if @code{vpt} is set to zero.

@subsubsection Page Location Traps
@cindex page location traps
@cindex traps, page location

@Defreq {wh, dist [@Var{name}]}
Call macro @var{name} when the vertical position @var{dist} on the page
is reached or passed in the downward direction.  Non-negative values for
@var{dist} set the trap relative to the top of the page; negative values
set the trap relative to the bottom of the page.  An existing
@emph{visible} trap (see below) at @var{dist} is removed; this is
@code{wh}'s sole function if @var{name} is missing.

A trap is sprung only if it is @dfn{visible}, meaning that its location
is reachable on the page@footnote{A trap planted at @samp{20i} or
@samp{-30i} will not be sprung on a page of length @samp{11i}.} and it
is not hidden by another trap at the same location already planted
there.

@cindex page headers
@cindex page footers
@cindex headers
@cindex footers
An example of how a macro package might set headers and footers follows.

@Example
.de hd                \" page header
'  sp .5i
.  tl '\\*[Title]''\\*[Date]'
'  sp .3i
..
.
.de fo                \" page footer

'  bp
..
.
.wh 0   hd            \" trap at top of the page
.wh -1i fo            \" trap one inch from bottom
@endExample

A trap above the top or at or below the bottom of the page can be made
visible by either moving it into the page area or increasing the page
length so that the trap is on the page.  Negative trap values always use
the @emph{current} page length; they are not converted to an absolute
vertical position.
@cindex page location traps, debugging
@cindex debugging page location traps
We can use the @code{ptr} request to dump our page location traps to the
standard error stream (@pxref{Debugging}).  Their positions are reported
in basic units appropriate to the device; an @code{nroff} device example
follows.

@Example
.pl 5i
.wh -1i xx
.ptr
    @error{} xx      -240
.pl 100i
.ptr
    @error{} xx      -240
@endExample

It is possible to have more than one trap at the same location (although
only one at a time can be visible); to achieve this, the traps must be
defined at different locations, then moved to the same place with the
@code{ch} request.  In the following example, the many empty lines
caused by the @code{bp} request are not shown in the output.

@Example
.de a

@Defreg {.t}
@cindex distance to next vertical position trap register (@code{.t})
@cindex trap, distance to next vertical position, register (@code{.t})
The read-only register @code{.t} holds the distance to the next vertical
position trap.  If there are no traps between the current position and
the bottom of the page, it contains the distance to the page bottom.
Within a diversion, in the absence of a diversion trap, this distance is
the largest representable integer in basic units---effectively infinite.
@endDefreg

@Defreq {ch, name [@Var{dist}]}
@cindex changing trap location (@code{ch})
@cindex trap, changing location (@code{ch})
Change the location of a trap by moving macro @var{name} to new location
@var{dist}, or by unplanting it altogether if @var{dist} is absent.
Parameters to @code{ch} are specified in the opposite order from
@code{wh}.  If @var{name} is the earliest planted macro of multiple
traps at the same location, (re)moving it from that location exposes the
macro next least recently planted at the same place.@footnote{It may
help to think of each trap location as maintaining a queue; @code{wh}
operates on the head of the queue, and @code{ch} operates on its tail.
Only the trap at the head of the queue is visible.}

Changing a trap's location is useful for building up footnotes in a
diversion to allow more space at the bottom of the page for them.

@c XXX

The same macro can be installed simultaneously at multiple locations;
however, only the earliest-planted instance---that has not yet been
deleted with @code{wh}---will be moved by @code{ch}.  The following

behavior.@footnote{@dots{}which is compatible with Heirloom Doctools

@cindex diversions, and traps
@cindex traps, and diversions
An important fact to consider while designing macros is that diversions
and traps do not interact normally.  For example, if a trap calls a
header macro (while outputting a diversion) that tries to change the
font on the current page, the effect is not visible before the diversion
has completely been printed (except for input protected with @code{\!}
or @code{\?}) since the data in the diversion is already formatted.  In
most cases, this is not the expected behaviour.

@cindex leading spaces macro (@code{lsm})
Set a leading space trap, calling the macro @var{name} when GNU
@code{troff} encounters leading spaces in an input line; the implicit
line break that normally happens in this case is suppressed.  If no
argument is supplied, the default leading space behavior is
(re-)established (@pxref{Breaking}).

The count of leading spaces on an input line is stored in register
@code{lsn}, and the amount of corresponding horizontal motion in
register @code{lss}, irrespective of whether a leading space trap is
set.  When it is, the leading spaces are removed from the input line,
and no motion is produced before calling @var{name}.

@c XXX The following discussion does not seem to be correct; leading
@c space traps don't "see" _any_ input tokens.  Nothing on the line is
@c passed to it as arguments, and tokens after leading spaces are
@c processed normally after the designated macro is interpolated. XXX
@c
@c The first thing a leading space macro sees is a token.  However, some
@c escape sequences, like @code{\f} and @code{\m}, are handled on the
@c fly (@pxref{Gtroff Internals} for a complete list) without creating a
@c token at all.  Consider a line that starts with two spaces followed
@c by @samp{\fIfoo}.  After skipping the spaces, @samp{\fI} is handled
@c as well such that @code{groff}'s current font is set to @code{I}, but
@c the leading space macro sees only @samp{foo} without the preceding
@c @samp{\fI}.  If the macro should see the font escape, you have to
@c ``protect'' it with something that creates a token, like the
@c non-printing input break; for example, @samp{\&\fIfoo}.

@cindex macro, end-of-input (@code{em})
Set a trap at the end of input, calling macro @var{name} after the last
line of the last input file has been processed.  If no argument is
given, any existing end-of-input trap is removed.

For example, if the document had to have a section at the bottom of the
last page for someone to approve it, the @code{em} request could be
used.

@Example
.de approval
\c
.  ne 3v
.  sp (\\n[.t]u - 3v)
.  in +4i
.  lc _
.  br
Approved:\t\a
.  sp
Date:\t\t\a
..
.
.em approval
@endExample

The @code{\c} in the above example needs explanation.  For historical
reasons (and for compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}), the
end-of-input macro exits as soon as it causes a page break and nothing
remains in the partially collected line.

Let us assume that there is no @code{\c} in the above @code{approval}
macro, and that the page is full and has been ended with, say, a
@code{br} request.  The @code{ne} request now causes the start of a new
page, which in turn makes @code{troff} exit immediately for the reasons
just described.  In most situations this is not intended.

To force processing of the whole end-of-input macro independently of
this behavior, it is thus advisable to insert something that starts an
empty partially collected line (@code{\c}) whenever there is a chance
that a page break can happen.  In the above example, the call of the
@code{ne} request assures that the remaining code stays on the same
page, so we have to insert @code{\c} only once.

The next example shows how to append three lines, then start a new page
unconditionally.  Since @w{@samp{.ne 1}} doesn't give the desired
effect---there is always one line available or we are already at the
beginning of the next page---we temporarily increase the page length by
one line so that we can use @w{@samp{.ne 2}}.

@Example
.de EM
.pl +1v
\c
.ne 2
line one
.br
\c
.ne 2
line two
.br
\c
.ne 2
line three
.br
.pl -1v
\c
'bp
..
.em EM
@endExample

This specific feature affects only the first potential page break caused
by the end-of-input macro; further page breaks emitted by the macro are
handled normally.

Another possible use of the @code{em} request is to make GNU
@code{troff} emit a single large page instead of multiple pages.  For
example, one may want to produce a long plain text file for reading
in a terminal or emulator without page footers and headers interrupting
the body of the document.  One approach is to set the page length at the
beginning of the document to a very large value to hold all the
text,@footnote{Another, taken by the @code{groff} @code{man} macros, is
to intercept @code{ne} requests and wrap @code{bp} ones.} and
automatically adjust it to the exact height of the document after the
text has been output.

@Example
.de adjust-page-length
.  br
.  pl \\n[nl]u \" \n[nl]: current vertical position
..
.
.de single-page-mode
.  pl 99999
.  em adjust-page-length
..
.
.\" Activate the above code if configured.
.if \n[do-continuous-rendering] \
.  single-page-mode
@endExample

Since only one end-of-input trap exists and another macro package may
already use it, care must be taken not to break the mechanism.  A simple
solution would be to append the above macro to the macro package's
end-of-input macro using the @code{am} request.

@node Diversions, Environments, Traps, gtroff Reference
@section Diversions
@cindex diversions

In @code{roff} systems it is possible to format text as if for output,
but instead of writing it immediately, one can @dfn{divert} the
formatted text into a named storage area.  The same name space is used
for such @emph{diversions} as for strings and macros;
@xref{Identifiers}.  Such text is sometimes said to be ``stored in a
macro'', but this coinage obscures the important distinction between
macros and strings on one hand and diversions on the other; the former
store @emph{unformatted} input text, and the latter capture
@emph{formatted} output.  Applications of diversions include ``keeps''
(preventing a page break from occurring at an inconvenient place by
forcing a set of output lines to be set as a group), footnotes, tables
of contents, and indices.
@cindex top-level diversion
@cindex diversion, top-level
For orthogonality it is said that GNU @code{troff} is in the
@dfn{top-level diversion} if no diversion is active (that is, formatted
output is being ``diverted'' immediately to the output device).

Dereferencing an undefined diversion will create an empty one of that
name and cause a warning in category @samp{mac} to be emitted
(@pxref{Debugging}).  A diversion does not exist for the purpose of
testing with the @code{d} conditional operator until its initial
definition ends (@pxref{Operators in Conditionals}).  The following
requests are used to create and alter diversions.

@DefreqList {di, [@Var{name}]}
@DefreqListEndx {da, [@Var{name}]}
@cindex beginning diversion (@code{di})
@cindex diversion, beginning (@code{di})
@cindex ending diversion (@code{di})
@cindex diversion, ending (@code{di})
@cindex appending to a diversion (@code{da})
@cindex diversion, appending (@code{da})
Start collecting formatted output in a diversion called @var{name}.  The
@code{da} request appends to the existing diversion called @var{name},
creating it if necessary.  The pending output line is diverted as well.
Switching to another (empty) environment (with the @code{ev} request)
avoids the inclusion of the current partially collected line;
@ref{Environments}.

Invoking @code{di} or @code{da} without an argument stops diverting
output to the diversion named by the most recent corresponding request.
If @code{di} or @code{da} is called without an argument when there is no
current diversion, a warning in category @samp{di} is produced.
@xref{Debugging}, for information about the enablement and suppression
of warnings.

@Example
Before the diversion.
.di yyy
In the diversion.
.br
.di
After the diversion.
.br
    @result{} After the diversion.
.yyy
    @result{} Before the diversion.  In the diversion.
@endExample
@endDefreq

@cindex box (diversion type)
Because it is often desirable to exclude the partially collected line
from a diversion, @code{groff} supports an alternative form of diversion
known as a @dfn{box}.

@DefreqList {box, [@Var{name}]}
@DefreqListEndx {boxa, [@Var{name}]}
Divert (or append) output to @var{name}, similarly to the @code{di} and
@code{da} requests, respectively.  Any output line pending when these
requests are invoked is @emph{not} included in the box.  Calling
@code{box} or @code{boxa} without an argument stops diverting output to
the box named by the most recent corresponding request; a pending output
line inside a diversion is discarded.

@Example
Before the box.
.box xxx
In the box.
.br
Hidden treasure.
.box
After the box.
.br
    @result{} Before the box.  After the box.
.xxx
    @result{} In the box.
@endExample
@endDefreq

Apart from pending output line inclusion and the request names that
populate them, boxes are handled exactly as diversions are.  All of the
following @code{groff} language elements can be used with them
interchangeably.

@DefregList {.z}
@DefregListEndx {.d}
@cindex @code{nl} register, and @code{.d}
@cindex nested diversions
@cindex diversion, nested
@cindex diversion name register (@code{.z})
@cindex vertical position in diversion register (@code{.d})
@cindex position, vertical, in diversion, register (@code{.d})
@cindex diversion, vertical position in, register (@code{.d})
Diversions may be nested.  The read-only string-valued register
@code{.z} contains the name of the current diversion.  The read-only
register @code{.d} contains the current vertical place in the diversion.
If the input text is not being diverted, @code{.d} reports the same
location as the register @code{nl}.
@endDefreg

@Defreg {.h}
@cindex high-water mark register (@code{.h})
@cindex mark, high-water, register (@code{.h})
@cindex position of lowest text line (@code{.h})
@cindex text line, position of lowest (@code{.h})
The read-only register @code{.h} stores the @dfn{high-water mark} on the
current page or in the current diversion.  It corresponds to the text
baseline of the lowest line on the page.@footnote{Thus, the ``water''
gets ``higher'' proceeding @emph{down} the page.}

@Example
.tm .h==\n[.h], nl==\n[nl]
    @result{} .h==0, nl==-1
This is a test.
.br
.sp 2
.tm .h==\n[.h], nl==\n[nl]
    @result{} .h==40, nl==120
@endExample

@cindex @code{.h} register, difference to @code{nl}
@cindex @code{nl} register, difference to @code{.h}

baselines and thus does not increase the value interpolated by

@cindex @code{boxa} request, and @code{dn} (@code{dl})
After completing a diversion, the writable registers @code{dn} and
@code{dl} contain the vertical and horizontal size of the diversion.
Only the lines just processed are counted: for the computation of
@code{dn} and @code{dl}, the requests @code{da} and @code{boxa} are
handled as if @code{di} and @code{box} had been used,
respectively---lines that have been already stored in the diversion
(box) are not taken into account.

@cindex transparent output (@code{\!}, @code{\?})
@cindex output, transparent (@code{\!}, @code{\?})
@dfn{Transparently} embed @var{anything} into the current diversion,
preventing requests, macro calls, and escape sequences from being
interpreted when read into a diversion.  This is useful for preventing
them from taking effect until the diverted text is actually output.  The
@code{\!} escape sequence transparently embeds input up to and including
the end of the line.  The @code{\?} escape sequence transparently embeds
input until its own next occurrence.

@noindent
@var{anything} may not contain newlines; use @code{\!} by itself to
embed newlines in a diversion.  The escape sequence @code{\?} is also
recognized in copy mode and turned into a single internal code; it is
this code that terminates @var{anything}.  Thus the following example
prints@tie{}4.

@Example
.nr x 1
.nf

.di
.nr x 2
.di e

If @code{\!} is used in the top-level diversion, its argument is
directly embedded into GNU @code{troff}'s intermediate output.  This can
be used, for example, to control a postprocessor that processes the data
before it is sent to an output driver.

@cindex @code{\?}, in top-level diversion
@cindex top-level diversion, and @code{\?}
@cindex diversion, top-level, and @code{\?}
The @code{\?} escape used in the top-level diversion produces no output

@cindex copy mode, and @code{output} request
@cindex mode, copy, and @code{output} request
@Defreq {output, string}
Emit @var{string} directly to GNU @code{troff}'s intermediate output
(subject to copy mode interpretation); this is similar to @code{\!} used
at the top level.  An initial double quote in @var{string} is stripped
off to allow initial blanks.

This request can't be used before the first page has started---if you
get an error, simply insert @code{.br} before the @code{output} request.

Without argument, @code{output} is ignored.

Use with caution!  It is normally only needed for mark-up used by a
postprocessor that does something with the output before sending it to
the output device, filtering out @var{string} again.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {asciify, div}

@cindex diversion, unformatting (@code{asciify})
@cindex @code{trin} request, and @code{asciify}
@dfn{Unformat} the diversion @var{div} in a way such that Unicode basic
Latin (@acronym{ASCII}) characters, characters translated with the
@code{trin} request, space characters, and some escape sequences, that
were formatted and diverted into @var{div} are treated like ordinary
input characters when @var{div} is reread.  Doing so can be useful in
conjunction with the @code{writem} request.  @code{asciify} can be also
used for gross hacks; for example, the following sets
register@tie{}@code{n} to@tie{}1.

@Example
.tr @@.
.di x
@@nr n 1
.br
.di
.tr @@@@
.asciify x
.x
@endExample

@code{asciify} cannot return all items in a diversion to their source
equivalent: nodes such as those produced by the @code{\N} escape
sequence will remain nodes, so the result cannot be guaranteed to be a
pure string.  @xref{Copy Mode}.  Glyph parameters such as the type face
and size are not preserved; use @code{unformat} to achieve that.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {unformat, div}
Like @code{asciify}, unformat the diversion @var{div}.  However,
@code{unformat} handles only tabs and spaces between words, the latter
usually arising from spaces or newlines in the input.  Tabs are treated
as input tokens, and spaces become adjustable again.  The vertical sizes
of lines are not preserved, but glyph information (font, type size,
space width, and so on) is retained.

@node Environments, Suppressing Output, Diversions, gtroff Reference
@section Environments
@cindex environments

As discussed in @ref{Deferring Output}, environments store most of the
parameters that control text processing.  A default environment named
@samp{0} exists when GNU @code{troff} starts up; it is modified by
formatting-related requests and escape sequences.

@cindex stack
You can create new environments and switch among them.  Only one is
current at any given time.  Active environments are managed using a
@dfn{stack}, a data structure supporting ``push'' and ``pop''
operations.  The current environment is at the top of the stack.
The same environment name can be pushed onto the stack multiple times,
possibly interleaved with others.

Popping the environment stack does not destroy the current environment;
it remains accessible by name and can be made current again by pushing
it at any time.  Environments cannot be renamed or deleted, and can only
be modified when current.  To inspect the environment stack, use the
@code{pev} request; see @ref{Debugging}.

Environments store the following information.

@itemize @bullet
@item
typeface parameters (size, family, style, glyph height and slant,
inter-word and inter-sentence space sizes)

@item
page parameters (line length, title length, vertical spacing, line
spacing, indentation, line numbering, centering, right-justifying,
underlining, hyphenation data)

Enter the environment @var{ident}, which is created if it does not
already exist, using the same parameters as for the default environment
used at startup.  With no argument, GNU @code{troff} switches to the
previous environment.

Invoking @code{ev} with an argument puts environment @var{ident} onto
the top of the environment stack.  (If it isn't already present in the
stack, this is a proper push.)  Without an argument, @code{ev} pops the
environment stack, making the previous environment current.  It is an
error to pop the environment stack with no previous environment
available.  The read-only string-valued register @code{.ev} contains the
name of the current environment---the one at the top of the stack.

of a book to be kept in a separate file.  However, files interpolated
with @code{so} are not preprocessed; to overcome this limitation, see
the @cite{gsoelim@r{(1)}} man page.

Since GNU @code{troff} replaces the entire control line with the
contents of a file, it matters whether @code{file} is terminated with a
newline or not.  Assume that file @file{xxx} contains only the word
@samp{foo} without a trailing newline.

@Example
The situation is
.so xxx
bar.
    @result{} The situation is foobar.
@endExample

@code{soquiet} works the same way, except that no warning diagnostic is
issued if @var{file} does not exist.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {pso, command}
Read the standard output from the specified @var{command} and include
it in place of the @code{pso} request.

@cindex safer mode
@cindex mode, safer
@cindex unsafe mode
@cindex mode, unsafe
This request causes an error if used in safer mode (which is the
default).  Use @code{groff}'s or @code{troff}'s @option{-U} option to
activate unsafe mode.

The comment regarding a final newline for the @code{so} request is valid
for @code{pso} also.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {mso, file}
@DefreqListEndx {msoquiet, file}
Identical to the @code{so} and @code{soquiet} requests, respectively,
except that @code{gtroff} searches for the specified @var{file} in the
same directories as macro files for the @option{-m} command-line option.
If the file name to be included has the form @file{@var{name}.tmac} and
it isn't found, @code{mso} tries to include @file{tmac.@var{name}} and
vice versa.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {trf, file}
@DefreqListEndx {cf, file}
@cindex transparent output (@code{cf}, @code{trf})
@cindex output, transparent (@code{cf}, @code{trf})

@cindex mode, copy, and @code{cf} request
@cindex @code{trf} request, and copy mode
@cindex copy mode, and @code{trf} request
@cindex mode, copy, and @code{trf} request
Transparently output the contents of @var{file}.  Each line is output as
if it were preceded by @code{\!}; however, the lines are @emph{not}
subject to copy mode interpretation.  If the file does not end with a
newline, then a newline is added (@code{trf} only).  For example, to
define a macro@tie{}@code{x} containing the contents of
file@tie{}@file{f}, use

@Example
.ev 1
.di x
.trf f
.di
.ev
@endExample

@noindent
The calls to @code{ev} prevent the partially collected output line
from becoming part of the diversion (@pxref{Diversions}).

Both @code{trf} and @code{cf}, when used in a diversion, embed a node
(@pxref{Gtroff Internals}) in it that, when reread, causes the contents
of @var{file} to be transparently copied to the output.  In
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, the contents of @var{file} are immediately
copied through to the output regardless of whether there is a current
diversion; this behaviour is so anomalous that it must be considered a
bug.

@cindex @code{trf} request, and invalid characters
@cindex characters, invalid for @code{trf} request
@cindex invalid characters for @code{trf} request

While @code{cf} copies the contents of @var{file} completely
unprocessed, @code{trf} disallows characters such as NUL that are not
valid @code{gtroff} input characters (@pxref{Identifiers}).

For @code{cf}, within a diversion, `completely unprocessed' means that
each line of a file to be inserted is handled as if it were preceded by
@code{\!\\!}.

Both requests cause a line break.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {nx, [@Var{file}]}
@cindex processing next file (@code{nx})
@cindex file, processing next (@code{nx})
@cindex next file, processing (@code{nx})
Force @code{gtroff} to continue processing of the file specified as an
argument.  If no argument is given, immediately jump to the end of file.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {rd, [@Var{prompt} [@Var{arg1} @Var{arg2} @dots{}]]}
@cindex reading from standard input (@code{rd})
@cindex standard input, reading from (@code{rd})
@cindex input, standard, reading from (@code{rd})
Read from standard input, and include what is read as though it were
part of the input file.  Text is read until a blank line is encountered.

If standard input is a TTY input device (keyboard), write @var{prompt}
to standard error, followed by a colon (or send BEL for a beep if no
argument is given).

Arguments after @var{prompt} are available for the input.  For example,
the line

@Example
.rd data foo bar
@endExample

with the input @w{@samp{This is \$2.}} prints

@Example
This is bar.
@endExample
@endDefreq

@cindex form letters
@cindex letters, form
Using the @code{nx} and @code{rd} requests, it is easy to set up form
letters.  The form letter template is constructed like this, putting the
following lines into a file called @file{repeat.let}:

@Example
.ce
\*(td
.sp 2
.nf
.rd
.sp
.rd
.fi
Body of letter.
.bp
.nx repeat.let
@endExample

@cindex @code{ex} request, used with @code{nx} and @code{rd}
@noindent
When this is run, a file containing the following lines should be
redirected in.  Requests included in this file are executed as though
they were part of the form letter.  The last block of input is the
@code{ex} request, which tells GNU @code{troff} to stop processing.  If
this were not there, @code{troff} would not know when to stop.

@Defreq {pi, pipe}

@code{pi} causes an error if used in safer mode (which is the default).
Use @code{groff}'s or @code{troff}'s @option{-U} option to activate
unsafe mode.

Multiple calls to @code{pi} are allowed, acting as a chain.  For
example,

@Example

is the same as @w{@samp{.pi foo | bar}}.

@cindex @code{groff}, and @code{pi} request

The intermediate output format of GNU @code{troff} is piped to the

@option{-Z} option normally causes a fatal error.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {sy, cmds}

For example, the following code fragment introduces the current time
into a document:

@cindex time, current

@pindex perl
@Example
.sy perl -e 'printf ".nr H %d\\n.nr M %d\\n.nr S %d\\n",\

.so /tmp/x\n[$$]
.sy rm /tmp/x\n[$$]
\nH:\nM:\nS
@endExample

@noindent
This works by having the Perl script (run by @code{sy}) print out the
@code{nr} requests that set the registers @code{H}, @code{M}, and
@code{S}, and then reading those commands in with the @code{so} request.

For most practical purposes, the registers @code{seconds},
@code{minutes}, and @code{hours}, which are initialized at startup of
GNU @code{troff}, should be sufficient.  Use the @code{af} request to
format their values for output.

@Example
.af hours 00
.af minutes 00
.af seconds 00
\n[hours]:\n[minutes]:\n[seconds]
@endExample

@cindex @code{system()} return value register (@code{systat})
The writable register @code{systat} contains the return value of the

@cindex file, appending to (@code{opena})
Open the specified @var{file} for writing and associates the specified

@cindex file, writing to (@code{write}, @code{writec})
Write to the file associated with the specified @var{stream}.  The
stream must previously have been the subject of an open request.  The
remainder of the line is interpreted as the @code{ds} request reads its
second argument: A leading @samp{"} is stripped, and it is read in
copy mode.

The @code{writec} request is like @code{write}, but only @code{write}
appends a newline to the data.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {writem, stream xx}
@cindex @code{asciify} request, and @code{writem}
Write the contents of the macro or string @var{xx} to the file

@var{xx} is read in copy mode, i.e., already formatted elements are

@code{asciify} request before calling @code{writem}.  Usually, this
means a loss of information.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {close, stream}
@cindex closing file (@code{close})
@cindex file, closing (@code{close})
Close the specified @var{stream}; the stream is no longer an acceptable

@node Postprocessor Access, Miscellaneous, I/O, gtroff Reference
@section Postprocessor Access
@cindex postprocessor access
@cindex access of postprocessor

There are two escape sequences that give information directly to the
postprocessor.  This is particularly useful for embedding PostScript
into the final document.

@DefreqList {device, xxx @r{@dots{}}}
@DefescListEndx {\\X, @code{'}, xxx @r{@dots{}}, @code{'}}
Embed all @var{xxx} arguments into GNU @code{troff} output as parameters
to a device control command @w{@samp{x X}}.  The meaning and
interpretation of such parameters is determined by the output driver or
other postprocessor.

@cindex @code{device} request, and copy mode
@cindex copy mode, and @code{device} request
@cindex mode, copy, and @code{device} request
The @code{device} request processes its arguments in copy mode
(@pxref{Copy Mode}).
@cindex @code{\&}, in @code{\X}
@cindex @code{\)}, in @code{\X}
@cindex @code{\%}, in @code{\X}
@ifnotinfo
@cindex @code{\:}, in @code{\X}
@end ifnotinfo
@ifinfo
@cindex @code{\@r{<colon>}}, in @code{\X}
@end ifinfo
By contrast, within @code{\X} arguments, the escape sequences @code{\&},
@code{\)}, @code{\%}, and @code{\:} are ignored, @code{\SP} and
@code{\~} are converted to single space characters, and @code{\\} has
its escape character stripped.  So that the basic Latin subset of the
Unicode character set@footnote{that is, ISO@tie{}646:1991-IRV or,
popularly, ``US-ASCII''} can be reliably encoded in device control
commands, seven special character escape sequences (@samp{\-},
@samp{\aq}, @samp{\dq}, @samp{\ga}, @samp{\ha}, @samp{\rs}, and
@samp{\ti},) are mapped to basic Latin glyphs; see the
@cite{groff_char@r{(7)}} man page.  The use of any other escape sequence
in @code{\X} arguments is normally an error.

@kindex use_charnames_in_special
@pindex DESC@r{, and @code{use_charnames_in_special}}
@cindex @code{\X}, and special characters
If the @code{use_charnames_in_special} directive appears in the output
device's @file{DESC} file, the use of special character escape sequences
is @emph{not} an error; they are simply output verbatim (with the
exception of the seven mapped to Unicode basic Latin characters,
discussed above).  For convenience, the backslash can be represented as
@samp{\\}.  @code{use_charnames_in_special} is currently used only by
@code{grohtml}.
@endDefesc

@DefreqList {devicem, xx}
@DefescItemx {\\Y, , n, }
@DefescItem {\\Y, (, nm, }
@DefescListEnd {\\Y, [, name, ]}
This is approximately equivalent to @samp{\X'\*[@var{name}]'}
(one-character name@tie{}@var{n}, two-character name @var{nm}).
However, the contents of the string or macro @var{name} are not
interpreted; also it is permitted for @var{name} to have been defined as
a macro and thus contain newlines (it is not permitted for the argument
to @code{\X} to contain newlines).  The inclusion of newlines requires
an extension to the @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} output format, and
confuses drivers that do not know about this extension (@pxref{Device
Control Commands}).

@c =====================================================================

@node Miscellaneous, Gtroff Internals, Postprocessor Access, gtroff Reference
@section Miscellaneous

This section documents parts of @code{gtroff} that cannot (yet) be
categorized elsewhere in this manual.

@DefreqList {nm, [@Var{start} [@Var{inc} [@Var{space} [@Var{indent}]]]]}
@DefregListEndx {.nm}
@cindex printing line numbers (@code{nm})
@cindex line numbers, printing (@code{nm})
@cindex numbers, line, printing (@code{nm})
Print line numbers.  @var{start} is the line number of the @emph{next}
output line.  @var{inc} indicates which line numbers are printed.  For
example, the value@tie{}5 means to emit only line numbers that are
multiples of@tie{}5; this defaults to@tie{}1.  @var{space} is the space
to be left between the number and the text; this defaults to one digit
space.  The fourth argument is the indentation of the line numbers,
defaulting to zero.  Both @var{space} and @var{indent} are given as
multiples of digit spaces; they can be negative also.  Without any
arguments, line numbers are turned off.

@code{gtroff} reserves three digit spaces for the line number (which is
printed right-justified) plus the amount given by @var{indent}; the
output lines are concatenated to the line numbers, separated by
@var{space}, and @emph{without} reducing the line length.  Depending on
the value of the horizontal page offset (as set with the @code{po}
request), line numbers that are longer than the reserved space stick
out to the left, or the whole line is moved to the right.

Parameters corresponding to missing arguments are not changed; any
non-digit argument (to be more precise, any argument starting with a
character valid as a delimiter for identifiers) is also treated as
missing.

If line numbering has been disabled with a call to @code{nm} without an
argument, it can be reactivated with @samp{.nm +0}, using the previously
active line numbering parameters.

The parameters of @code{nm} are associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).  The current output line number is available in
the register @code{ln}.

The @code{.nm} register tracks the enablement status of line numbering.
Temporary suspension of numbering with the @code{nn} request does
@emph{not} alter its value.

@Example
.po 1m
.ll 2i
This test shows how line numbering works with groff.
.nm 999
This test shows how line numbering works with groff.
.br
.nm xxx 3 2
.ll -\w'0'u
This test shows how line numbering works with groff.
.nn 2
This test shows how line numbering works with groff.
@endExample

@noindent
The result is as follows.

@Example
 This  test shows how
 line numbering works
 999 with   groff.   This
1000 test shows how  line
1001 numbering works with
1002 groff.

 This test shows how
1005  line      numbering
      works with groff.
@endExample
@endDefreq

@Defreq {nn, [@Var{skip}]}
Temporarily turn off line numbering.  The argument is the number of
lines not to be numbered; this defaults to@tie{}1.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {mc, glyph [@Var{dist}]}
@cindex margin glyph (@code{mc})
@cindex glyph, for margins (@code{mc})
Print a @dfn{margin character} to the right of the
text.@footnote{@dfn{Margin character} is a misnomer since it is an
output glyph.}  The first argument is the glyph to be printed.  The
second argument is the distance away from the right margin.  If missing,
the previously set value is used; default is 10@dmn{pt}).  For text
lines that are too long (that is, longer than the text length plus
@var{dist}), the margin character is directly appended to the lines.

With no arguments the margin character is turned off.  If this occurs
before a break, no margin character is printed.

For compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, a call to @code{mc}
to set the margin character can't be undone immediately; at least one
line gets a margin character.  Thus

@Example
.ll 1i
.mc \[br]
.mc
xxx
.br
xxx
@endExample

@noindent
produces

@Example
xxx        |
xxx
@endExample

@cindex @code{tl} request, and @code{mc}
For empty lines and lines produced by the @code{tl} request no margin
character is emitted.

The margin character is associated with the environment
(@pxref{Environments}).

@pindex nrchbar
@pindex changebar
This is quite useful for indicating text that has changed, and, in fact,
there are programs available for doing this (they are called
@code{nrchbar} and @code{changebar} and can be found in any
@samp{comp.sources.unix} archive).

@Example
.ll 3i
.mc |
This paragraph is highlighted with a margin
character.
.sp
Vertical space isn't marked.
.br
\&
.br
But we can fake it with `\&'.
@endExample

Result:

@Example
This  paragraph is highlighted |
with a margin character.       |

Vertical space isn't marked.   |
                               |
But we can fake it with `\&'.  |
@endExample
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {psbb, filename}
@DefregItemx {llx}
@DefregItemx {lly}
@DefregItemx {urx}
@DefregListEndx {ury}
@cindex PostScript, bounding box
@cindex bounding box
Retrieve the bounding box of the PostScript image found in
@var{filename}.  The file must conform to Adobe's @dfn{Document
Structuring Conventions} (DSC); the command searches for a
@code{%%BoundingBox} comment and extracts the bounding box values into
the registers @code{llx}, @code{lly}, @code{urx}, and @code{ury}.  If an
error occurs (for example, @code{psbb} cannot find the
@code{%%BoundingBox} comment), it sets the four registers to zero.

The search path for @var{filename} can be controlled with the
@option{-I} command-line option.

@c =====================================================================

@node Gtroff Internals, Debugging, Miscellaneous, gtroff Reference
@section @code{gtroff} Internals

@cindex input token
@cindex token, input
@cindex output node
@cindex node, output
@code{gtroff} processes input in three steps.  One or more input
characters are converted to an @dfn{input token}.@footnote{Except the
escape sequences @code{\f}, @code{\F}, @code{\H}, @code{\m}, @code{\M},
@code{\R}, @code{\s}, and @code{\S}, which are processed immediately if
not in copy mode.}  Then, one or more input tokens are converted to
an @dfn{output node}.  Finally, output nodes are converted to the
intermediate output language understood by all output devices.

Actually, before step one happens, @code{gtroff} converts certain escape
sequences into reserved input characters (not accessible by the user);
such reserved characters are used for other internal processing also --
this is the very reason why not all characters are valid input.
@xref{Identifiers}, for more on this topic.

For example, the input string @samp{fi\[:u]} is converted into a
character token @samp{f}, a character token @samp{i}, and a special
token @samp{:u} (representing u@tie{}umlaut).  Later on, the character
tokens @samp{f} and @samp{i} are merged to a single output node
representing the ligature glyph @samp{fi} (provided the current font has
a glyph for this ligature); the same happens with @samp{:u}.  All output
glyph nodes are `processed', which means that they are invariably
associated with a given font, font size, advance width, etc.  During the
formatting process, @code{gtroff} itself adds various nodes to control
the data flow.

Macros, diversions, and strings collect elements in two chained lists: a
list of input tokens that have been passed unprocessed, and a list of
output nodes.  Consider the following diversion.

@Example
.di xxx
a
\!b
c
.br
.di
@endExample

@noindent
It contains these elements.

@multitable {@i{vertical size node}} {token list} {element number}
@item node list               @tab token list @tab element number

@item @i{line start node}     @tab ---        @tab 1
@item @i{glyph node @code{a}} @tab ---        @tab 2
@item @i{word space node}     @tab ---        @tab 3
@item ---                     @tab @code{b}   @tab 4
@item ---                     @tab @code{\n}  @tab 5
@item @i{glyph node @code{c}} @tab ---        @tab 6
@item @i{vertical size node}  @tab ---        @tab 7
@item @i{vertical size node}  @tab ---        @tab 8
@item ---                     @tab @code{\n}  @tab 9
@end multitable

@cindex @code{\v}, internal representation
@noindent
Elements 1, 7, and@tie{}8 are inserted by @code{gtroff}; the latter two
(which are always present) specify the vertical extent of the last line,
possibly modified by @code{\x}.  The @code{br} request finishes the
pending output line, inserting a newline input token, which is
subsequently converted to a space when the diversion is reread.  Note
that the word space node has a fixed width that isn't adjustable
anymore.  To convert horizontal space nodes back to input tokens, use
the @code{unformat} request.

Macros only contain elements in the token list (and the node list is
empty); diversions and strings can contain elements in both lists.

Note that the @code{chop} request simply reduces the number of elements
in a macro, string, or diversion by one.  Exceptions are
@dfn{compatibility save} and @dfn{compatibility ignore} input tokens,
which are ignored.  The @code{substring} request also ignores those
input tokens.

Some requests like @code{tr} or @code{cflags} work on glyph identifiers
only; this means that the associated glyph can be changed without
destroying this association.  This can be very helpful for substituting
glyphs.  In the following example, we assume that glyph @samp{foo} isn't
available by default, so we provide a substitution using the
@code{fchar} request and map it to input character @samp{x}.

@Example
.fchar \[foo] foo
.tr x \[foo]
@endExample

@noindent
Now let us assume that we install an additional special font @samp{bar}
that has glyph @samp{foo}.

@Example
.special bar
.rchar \[foo]
@endExample

@noindent
Since glyphs defined with @code{fchar} are searched before glyphs in
special fonts, we must call @code{rchar} to remove the definition of the
fallback glyph.  Anyway, the translation is still active; @samp{x} now
maps to the real glyph @samp{foo}.

@cindex compatibility mode, and parameters
@cindex mode, compatibility, and parameters
@cindex arguments, and compatibility mode
@cindex parameters, and compatibility mode
@cindex macro arguments, and compatibility mode
@cindex request arguments, and compatibility mode
Macro and request arguments preserve compatibility mode enablement.

@Example
.cp 1     \" switch to compatibility mode
.de xx
\\$1
..
.cp 0     \" switch compatibility mode off
.xx caf\['e]
    @result{} caf
@endExample

@noindent
Since compatibility mode is enabled while @code{de} is invoked, the
macro @code{xx} enables compatibility mode when it is called.  Argument
@code{$1} can still be handled properly because it inherits the
compatibility mode enablement status that was active at the point where
@code{xx} was called.

After interpolation of the parameters, the compatibility save and
restore tokens are removed.

GNU @code{troff} is not the easiest language to debug, in part thanks to
its design features of recursive interpolation and the use of multi-stage
pipeline processing in the surrounding system.  Nevertheless there exist
several features useful for troubleshooting.

Preprocessors use the @code{lf} request to preserve the identity of the
line numbers and names of input files.  GNU @code{troff} emits a variety
of error diagnostics and supports several categories of warning; the
output of these can be selectively suppressed.  Backtraces can be
enabled when errors or warnings occur, or triggered on demand.  The
@code{tm} and related requests can be used to emit customized diagnostic
messages or for instrumentation while troubleshooting.  The @code{ex}
and @code{ab} requests cause early termination with successful and error
exit codes respectively, to halt further processing when continuing
would be fruitless.  The state of the formatter can be examined with
requests that write lists of defined names (macros, strings, and
diversions), environments, registers, and page location traps to the
standard error stream.

Change the line number and optionally the file name GNU @code{troff}
shall use for error and warning messages.  @var{line} is the input line
number of the @emph{next} line.  Without an argument, the request is
ignored.

This request is primarily a debugging aid for documents that undergo
preprocessing.  Programs like @command{tbl} that transform input in
their own languages to @code{roff} requests use it so that any
diagnostic messages emitted by @code{troff} correspond to the original
source document.

The @code{tm} request ignores leading spaces of @var{string}; @code{tm1}
handles its argument similar to the @code{ds} request: a leading double
quote in @var{string} is stripped to allow initial blanks.

The @code{tmc} request is similar to @code{tm1} but does not append a
newline (as is done in @code{tm} and @code{tm1}).
@endDefreq

@Defreq {ab, [@Var{string}]}

a failure status.

@cindex @code{ex} request, use in debugging

When doing something involved, it is useful to leave the debugging
statements in the code and have them turned on by a command-line flag.

To activate such statements, use the @option{-r} option to set the

If it is known in advance that there are many errors and no useful

@cindex dumping symbol table (@code{pm})
@cindex symbol table, dumping (@code{pm})
Report, to the standard error stream, the names of all defined macros,

@code{troff} sometimes adds nodes by itself, the returned sizes can be
larger than expected.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {pnr, }

planted but subsequently (re)moved, are printed as well.
@c "because they can affect the priority of subsequently planted traps."
@c XXX Is that right?  It's useful to print the empty slots, I think,
@c but a trap planted in an "empty" slot with .wh will become active.
@c The slot seems to act as an immobile dummy list head, but does not

Instruct @code{gtroff} to flush its output immediately.  The intent is
for interactive use, but this behaviour is currently not implemented in
@code{gtroff}.  Contrary to Unix @code{troff}, TTY output is sent to a
device driver also (@code{grotty}), making it non-trivial to communicate
interactively.

This request causes a line break.

@Defreq {backtrace, }
@cindex backtrace of input stack (@code{backtrace})

there is no limit: recursion can continue until program memory is
exhausted.  The default is 1,000.
@endDefreg

@Defreq {warnscale, si}
Set the scaling indicator used in warnings to @var{si}.  Valid values
for @var{si} are @samp{u}, @samp{i}, @samp{c}, @samp{p}, and @samp{P}.
At startup, it is set to @samp{i}.
@endDefreq

@Defreq {spreadwarn, [@Var{limit}]}
Emit a @code{break} warning if the additional space inserted for each
space between words in an output line adjusted to both margins with
@w{@samp{.ad b}} is larger than or equal to @var{limit}.  A negative
value is treated as zero; an absent argument toggles the warning on and
off without changing @var{limit}.  The default scaling indicator is
@samp{m}.  At startup, @code{spreadwarn} is inactive and @var{limit} is
3@dmn{m}.

For example,

@Example
.spreadwarn 0.2m

@cindex warnings
GNU @code{troff} has command-line options for reporting warnings

occurs.

@DefreqList {warn, [@Var{n}]}
@DefregListEndx {.warn}
@cindex warning level (@code{warn})
Select the categories, or ``types'', of reported warnings.
@var{n}@tie{}is the sum of the numeric codes associated with each
warning category that is to be enabled; all other categories are
disabled.  The categories and their associated codes are listed in
@ref{Warnings}.  For example, @samp{.warn 0} disables all warnings, and
@samp{.warn 1} disables all warnings except those about missing glyphs.
If no argument is given, all warning categories are enabled.

@subsection Warnings
@cindex warnings

Warning diagnostics emitted by GNU @code{troff} are divided into named,
numbered categories.  The name associated with each warning category is
used by the @option{-w} and @option{-W} options.  Each category is also
assigned a power of two; the sum of enabled category values is used by
the @code{warn} request and the @code{.warn} register.

Warnings of each category are produced under the following
circumstances.

@item scale
@itemx 32
An inappropriate scaling unit was used in a numeric expression.

@item range
@itemx 64
A numeric expression was out of range for its context.

@item syntax
@itemx 128
A self-contradictory hyphenation mode was requested; an empty or
incomplete numeric expression was encountered; an operand to a numeric
operator was missing; an attempt was made to define a recursive, empty,
or nonsensical character class; or a @code{groff} extension conditional
expression operator was used while in compatibility mode.

@cindex @code{di} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{da} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{box} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{boxa} request, and warnings
A @code{di}, @code{da}, @code{box}, or @code{boxa} request was invoked
without an argument when there was no current diversion.

@cindex @code{di} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{da} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{box}, @code{boxa} requests, and warnings
@cindex @code{\*}, and warnings
An undefined string, macro, or diversion was used.  When such an object
is dereferenced, an empty one of that name is automatically created.
So, in most cases, at most one warning is given for each name.

This warning is also emitted upon an attempt to move an unplanted trap
macro (@pxref{Page Location Traps}).  In such cases, the unplanted macro
is @emph{not} dereferenced, so it is not created if it does not exist.

@item reg
@itemx 1024
@cindex @code{nr} request, and warnings
@cindex @code{\R}, and warnings
@cindex @code{\n}, and warnings
An undefined register was used.  When an undefined register is
dereferenced, it is automatically defined with a value of@tie{}0.  So,
in most cases, at most one warning is given for each name.

@item tab
@itemx 2048
@cindex @code{\t}, and warnings
A tab character was encountered where a number was expected, or appeared
in an unquoted macro argument.

@item right-brace
@itemx 4096
@cindex @code{\@}}, and warnings
A right brace escape sequence @code{\@}} was encountered where a number
was expected.

@item missing
@itemx 8192
A request was invoked with a mandatory argument absent.

@item input
@itemx 16384
An invalid character occurred on the input stream.

@item escape
@itemx 32768
An unsupported escape sequence was encountered.

@item space
@itemx 65536
@cindex compatibility mode
A space was missing between a request or macro and its argument.  This
warning is produced when an undefined name longer than two characters is
encountered and the first two characters of the name constitute a
defined name.  No request is invoked, no macro called, and an empty
macro is not defined.  This category is enabled by default.  It never
occurs in compatibility mode.

@item font
@itemx 131072
A non-existent font was selected.  This category is enabled by default.

@item ig
@itemx 262144
An invalid escape sequence occurred in input ignored using the @code{ig}
request.  This warning category diagnoses a condition that is an error
when it occurs in non-ignored input.

@item color
@itemx 524288
An undefined color was selected, an attempt was made to define a color
using an unrecognized color space, an invalid component in a color
definition was encountered, or an attempt was made to redefine a default
color.

@item file
@itemx 1048576
An attempt was made to load a file that does not exist.  This category
is enabled by default.

All warning categories except @samp{di}, @samp{mac} and @samp{reg}.
This shorthand is intended to produce all warnings that are useful with

@cindex differences in implementation
@cindex incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex compatibility mode
@cindex mode, compatibility

GNU @code{troff} has a number of features that cause incompatibilities
with documents written using old versions of @code{troff}.  Some GNU
extensions to @code{troff} have become supported by other
implementations.

@cindex @code{pi} request, disabled by default
@cindex @code{sy} request, disabled by default
The formatter operates in ``safer'' mode by default; to mitigate risks
from untrusted input documents, the @code{pi} and @code{sy} requests are
disabled.  GNU @code{troff}'s @option{-U} option enables ``unsafe
mode'', restoring their function (and enabling additional @code{groff}
extension requests, @code{open}, @code{opena}, and @code{pso}).

@cindex adjustment to both margins, difference from @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex rivers
When adjusting to both margins, @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} at first
adjusts spaces starting from the right; GNU @code{troff} begins from
the left.  Both implementations adjust spaces from opposite ends on
alternating output lines in this adjustment mode to prevent ``rivers''
in the text.

@cindex hyphenation, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
GNU @code{troff} does not always hyphenate words as @acronym{AT&T}
@code{troff} does.  The @acronym{AT&T} implementation uses a set of
hard-coded rules specific to English, while GNU @code{troff} uses
language-specific hyphenation pattern files derived from @TeX{}.
Furthermore, in old versions of @code{troff} there was a limited amount
of space to store hyphenation exceptions (arguments to the @code{hw}
request); GNU @code{troff} has no such restriction.

@cindex long names
@cindex names, long
@cindex @code{\*}, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex @code{\n}, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Long names may be GNU @code{troff}'s most obvious innovation.
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} interprets @samp{.dsabcd} as defining a
string @samp{ab} with contents @samp{cd}.  Normally, GNU @code{troff}
interprets this as a call of a macro named @code{dsabcd}.
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} also interprets @samp{\*[} and @samp{\n[} as
an interpolation of a string or register, respectively, named @samp{[}.
In GNU @code{troff}, however, the @samp{[} is normally interpreted as
delimiting a long name.  In compatibility mode, GNU @code{troff}
interprets names in the traditional way, which means that they are
limited to one or two characters.

@DefreqList {cp, [@Var{n}]}
@DefregListEndx {.C}
If @var{n} is missing or non-zero, turn on compatibility mode;
otherwise, turn it off.

The read-only register @code{.C} is@tie{}1 if compatibility mode is on,
0@tie{}otherwise.

Compatibility mode can be also turned on with the @option{-C}
command-line option.
@endDefreq

@DefreqList {do, name}
@DefregListEndx {.cp}
The @code{do} request interprets the string, request, diversion, or
macro @var{name} (along with any further arguments) with compatibility
mode disabled.  Compatibility mode is restored (only if it was active)
when the @emph{expansion} of @var{name} is interpreted; that is, the
restored compatibility state applies to the contents of the macro,
string, or diversion @var{name} as well as data read from files or pipes
if @var{name} is any of the @code{so}, @code{soquiet}, @code{mso},
@code{msoquiet}, or @code{pso} requests.

The following example illustrates several aspects of @code{do} behavior.

@Example
.de mac1
FOO
..
.de1 mac2
groff
.mac1
..
.de mac3
compatibility
.mac1
..
.de ma
\\$1
..
.cp 1
.do mac1
.do mac2 \" mac2, defined with .de1, calls "mac1"
.do mac3 \" mac3 calls "ma" with argument "c1"
.do mac3 \[ti] \" groff syntax accepted in .do arguments
    @result{} FOO groff FOO compatibility c1 ~
@endExample

The read-only register @code{.cp}, meaningful only when dereferenced
from a @code{do} request, is@tie{}1 if compatibility mode was on when
the @code{do} request was encountered, and 0@tie{}if it was not.  This
register is specialized and may require a statement of rationale.

When writing macro packages or documents that use GNU @code{troff}
features and which may be mixed with other packages or documents that do
not---common scenarios include serial processing of man pages or use of
the @code{so} or @code{mso} requests---you may desire correct operation
regardless of compatibility mode enablement in the surrounding context.
It may occur to you to save the existing value of @samp{\n(.C} into a
register, say, @samp{_C}, at the beginning of your file, turn
compatibility mode off with @samp{.cp 0}, then restore it from that
register at the end with @samp{.cp \n(_C}.  At the same time, a modular
design of a document or macro package may lead you to multiple layers of
inclusion.  You cannot use the same register name everywhere or you risk
``clobbering'' the value from a preceding or enclosing context.  The
two-character register name space of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} is
confining and mnemonically challenging; you may wish to use the more
capacious name space of GNU @code{troff}.  However, attempting @samp{.nr
_my_saved_C \n(.C} will not work in compatibility mode; the register
name is too long.  ``This is exactly what @code{do} is for,'' you think,
@samp{.do nr _my_saved_C \n(.C}.  The foregoing will always save zero to
your register, because @code{do} turns compatibility mode @emph{off}
while it interprets its argument list.

@need 375 @c 250 < x < 500
To robustly save compatibility mode before switching it off, use

@Example
.do nr _my_saved_C \n[.cp]
.cp 0
@endExample

at the beginning of your file, followed by

@Example
.cp \n[_my_saved_C]
.do rr _my_saved_C
@endExample

at the end.  As in the C language, we all have to share one big
name space, so choose a register name that is unlikely to collide with
other uses.
@endDefreq

@cindex output device name string (@code{.T}), in other implementations
GNU @code{troff} predefines a string @code{.T} containing the argument
given to the @option{-T} command-line option, namely the current output
device (for example, @samp{pdf} or @samp{utf8}).  The existence of this
string is a common feature of post-CSTR@tie{}#54
@code{troff}s@footnote{DWB@tie{}3.3, Solaris, Heirloom Doctools, and
Plan@tie{}9 @code{troff} all support it.} but valid values are specific
to each implementation.

@cindex output device usage register (@code{.T}), incompatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
The (read-only) register @code{.T} interpolates@tie{}1 if GNU
@code{troff} is called with the @option{-T} command-line option, and
0@tie{}otherwise.  This behavior differs from AT&T @code{troff}, which
interpolated@tie{}1 only if @code{nroff} was the formatter and was
called with @option{-T}.

@cindex @code{lf} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} and other implementations handle the
@code{lf} request differently.  For them, its @var{line} argument
changes the line number of the @emph{current} line.

@cindex environment availability and naming, incompatibilities with
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} had only environments named @samp{0},
@samp{1}, and @samp{2}.  In GNU @code{troff}, any number of environments
may exist, using any valid identifiers for their names
(@pxref{Identifiers}.)

@cindex input level in delimited arguments
@cindex interpolation depth in delimited arguments
@cindex delimited arguments, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Normally, GNU @code{troff} preserves the interpolation depth in
delimited arguments, but not in compatibility mode.

@Example
.ds xx '
\w'abc\*(xxdef'
    @result{} 168 @r{(normal mode on a terminal device)}
    @result{} 72def' @r{(compatibility mode on a terminal device)}

@cindex @code{\s}, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex @code{\S}, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Furthermore, the escape sequences @code{\f}, @code{\H}, @code{\m},
@code{\M}, @code{\R}, @code{\s}, and @code{\S} are transparent for the
purpose of recognizing a control character at the beginning of a line
only in compatibility mode.  For example, this code produces bold output
in both cases, but the text differs.

GNU @code{troff} does not allow the use of the escape sequences
@code{\|}, @code{\^}, @code{\&}, @code{\@{}, @code{\@}},
@code{\@key{SP}}, @code{\'}, @code{\`}, @code{\-}, @code{\_}, @code{\!},
@code{\%}, and @code{\c} in names of strings, macros, diversions,
registers, fonts, or environments; @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} does.
The @code{\A} escape sequence (@pxref{Identifiers}) may be helpful in
avoiding use of these escape sequences in names.

@cindex @code{\s}, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Normally, the syntax form @code{\s}@var{n} accepts only a single
character (a digit) for @var{n}, consistently with other forms that
originated in @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, like @code{\*}, @code{\$},
@code{\f}, @code{\g}, @code{\k}, @code{\n}, and @code{\z}.  In
compatibility mode only, a non-zero@tie{}@var{n} must be in the range
4--39.  Legacy documents relying upon this quirk of parsing@footnote{The
Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter (the original device target for
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}) supported only a few discrete type sizes
in the range 6--36 points, so Ossanna contrived a special case in the
parser to do what the user must have meant.  Kernighan warned of this in
the 1992 revision of CSTR@tie{}#54 (2.3), and more recently, McIlroy
referred to it as a ``living fossil''.} should be migrated to another

@cindex @code{ps} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Fractional type sizes cause one noteworthy incompatibility.  In
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} the @code{ps} request ignores scale
indicators and thus @samp{.ps 10u} sets the type size to
10@tie{}points, whereas in GNU @code{troff} it sets the type size to
10@tie{}@emph{scaled} points.  @xref{Fractional Type Sizes}.

@cindex @code{ab} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
The @code{ab} request differs from @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}:
GNU @code{troff} writes no message to the standard error stream if no
arguments are given, and it exits with a failure status instead of a
successful one.

@cindex @code{bp} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
The @code{bp} request differs from @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}:
GNU @code{troff} does not accept a scaling indicator on the argument, a
page number; the former (somewhat uselessly) does.

@cindex @code{pm} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
The @code{pm} request differs from @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}:
GNU @code{troff} reports the sizes of macros, strings, and diversions in
bytes and ignores an argument to report only the sum of the sizes.

@cindex @code{ss} request, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
Unlike @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, GNU @code{troff} does not ignore the
@code{ss} request if the output is a terminal device; instead, the
values of minimal inter-word and additional inter-sentence space are
each rounded down to the nearest multiple of@tie{}12.

@cindex characters, input, and output glyphs, compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex glyphs, output, and input characters, compatibility with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
In GNU @code{troff} there is a fundamental difference between
(unformatted) input characters and (formatted) output glyphs.
Everything that affects how a glyph is output is stored with the glyph
node; once a glyph node has been constructed, it is unaffected by any
subsequent requests that are executed, including @code{bd}, @code{cs},
@code{tkf}, @code{tr}, or @code{fp} requests.  Normally, glyphs are
constructed from input characters immediately before the glyph is added
to the current output line.  Macros, diversions, and strings are all, in
fact, the same type of object; they contain lists of input characters
and glyph nodes in any combination.  Special characters can be both:
before being added to the output, they act as input entities;
afterward, they denote glyphs.  A glyph node does not behave like an
input character for the purposes of macro processing; it does not
inherit any of the special properties that the input character from
which it was constructed might have had.  Consider the following
example.

@Example
.di x
\\\\
.br
.di
.x
@endExample

@noindent
It prints @samp{\\} in GNU @code{troff}; each pair of input backslashes
is turned into one output backslash and the resulting output backslashes
are not interpreted as escape characters when they are reread.
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} would interpret them as escape characters
when they were reread and would end up printing one @samp{\}.

@cindex printing backslash (@code{\\}, @code{\e}, @code{\E}, @code{\[rs]})
@cindex backslash, printing (@code{\\}, @code{\e}, @code{\E}, @code{\[rs]})

@cindex transparent output, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
@cindex output, transparent, incompatibilities with @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}
One correct way to obtain a printable backslash in most documents is to
use the @code{\e} escape sequence; this always prints a single instance
of the current escape character,@footnote{Naturally, if you've changed
the escape character, you need to prefix the @code{e} with whatever it
is---and you'll likely get something other than a backslash in the
output.} regardless of whether or not it is used in a diversion; it
also works in both GNU @code{troff} and @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.

The other correct way, appropriate in contexts independent of the
backslash's common use as a @code{troff} escape character---perhaps in
discussion of character sets or other programming languages---is
the character escape @code{\(rs} or @code{\[rs]}, for ``reverse
solidus'', from its name in the @acronym{ECMA-6} (@acronym{ISO/IEC} 646)
standard.@footnote{This escape sequence is not portable to
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, but is to its lineal descendant, Heirloom
Doctools @code{troff}, as of its 060716 release (July 2006).}

To store an escape sequence in a diversion that is interpreted when the
diversion is reread, either use the traditional @code{\!} transparent
output facility, or, if this is unsuitable, the new @code{\?} escape
sequence.  @xref{Diversions} and @ref{Gtroff Internals}.

In the somewhat pathological case where a diversion exists containing a
partially collected line and a partially collected line at the top-level
diversion has never existed, @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} will output the
partially collected line at the end of input; GNU @code{troff} will not.

@cindex control sequences, for terminals
The @option{-c} option tells @code{grotty} to use an output format
compatible with paper terminals, like the Teletype machines for which
@code{roff} and @code{nroff} were first developed but which are no
longer in wide use.  SGR escape sequences (from ISO@tie{}6429) are not
emitted.  Instead, @code{grotty} overstrikes, representing a bold
character @var{c} with the sequence @samp{@var{c} BACKSPACE @var{c}} and
an italic character @var{c} with the sequence @samp{_ BACKSPACE
@var{c}}.  Furthermore, color output is disabled.  The same effect can
be achieved either by setting the @env{GROFF_NO_SGR} environment
variable or by using a @code{groff} escape sequence within the document;
see the subsection ``Device control commands'' of the
@cite{grotty@r{(1)}} man page for details.

The legacy output format can be rendered on a video terminal (or
emulator) by piping @code{grotty}'s output through @code{ul},
@c from bsdmainutils 11.1.2+b1 (on Debian Buster)
which may render bold italics as reverse video.
@c 'more' from util-linux 2.33.1 (on Debian Buster) neither renders
@c double-struck characters as bold nor supports -b, but does render
@c SGR sequences (including color) with no flags required.
Some implementations of @code{more} are also able to display these
sequences; you may wish to experiment with that command's @option{-b}
option.
@c Version 487 of...
@code{less} renders legacy bold and italics without requiring options.
In contrast to the teletype output drivers of some other @code{roff}
implementations, @code{grotty} never outputs reverse line feeds.  There
is therefore no need to filter its output through @code{col}.

input.  A filename of @code{-} will also cause @code{grohtml} to read
the standard input.  @acronym{HTML} output is written to the standard
output.  When @code{grohtml} is run by @code{groff}, options can be
passed to @code{grohtml} using @code{groff}'s @option{-P} option.

@code{grohtml} invokes @code{groff} twice.  In the first pass, pictures,
equations, and tables are rendered using the @code{ps} device, and in
the second pass @acronym{HTML} output is generated by the @code{html}
device.

@code{grohtml} always writes output in @code{UTF-8} encoding and has
built-in entities for all non-composite Unicode characters.  In spite of
this, @code{groff} may issue warnings about unknown special characters
if they can't be found during the first pass.  Such warnings can be
safely ignored unless the special characters appear inside a table or
equation, in which case glyphs for these characters must be defined for
the @code{ps} device as well.

This output device is fully documented on its man page,
@cite{grohtml@r{(1)}}.

@section @code{gtroff} Output

This section describes the @code{groff} intermediate output format
produced by GNU @code{troff}.

As @code{groff} is a wrapper program around GNU @code{troff} and
automatically calls an output driver (or ``postprocessor''), this output
does not show up normally.  This is why it is called
@emph{intermediate}.  @code{groff} provides the option @option{-Z} to
inhibit postprocessing such that the produced intermediate output is
sent to standard output just as it is when calling GNU @code{troff}
directly.

@cindex @code{troff} output
@cindex output, @code{troff}
@cindex intermediate output
@cindex output, intermediate
Here, the term @dfn{troff output} describes what is output by
GNU @code{troff}, while @dfn{intermediate output} refers to the language
that is accepted by the parser that prepares this output for the output
drivers.  This parser handles whitespace more flexibly than
@acronym{AT&T}'s implementation and implements obsolete elements for
compatibility; otherwise, both formats are the same.@footnote{The parser
and postprocessor for intermediate output can be found in the file@*
@file{@var{groff-source-dir}/src/libs/libdriver/input.cpp}.}

The main purpose of the intermediate output concept is to facilitate the
development of postprocessors by providing a common programming
interface for all devices.  It has a language of its own that is
completely different from the @code{gtroff} language.  While the
@code{gtroff} language is a high-level programming language for text
processing, the intermediate output language is a kind of low-level
assembler language by specifying all positions on the page for writing
and drawing.

The intermediate output produced by @code{gtroff} is fairly readable,
while output from @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} is rather hard to
understand because of strange habits that are still supported, but not
used any longer by @code{gtroff}.

@subsection Language Concepts

The fundamental operation of the GNU @code{troff} formatter is the
translation of the @code{groff} input language into a device-independent
form primarily concerned with what has to be written or drawn at
specific positions on the output device.  This language is simple and
imperative.  In the following discussion, the term @dfn{command} always
refers to this intermediate output language, and never to the
@code{groff} language intended for direct use by document authors.
Intermediate output commands comprise several categories: glyph output;
font, color, and text size selection; motion of the printing position;
page advancement; drawing of geometric primitives; and device control
commands, a catch-all for operations not easily classified as any of the
foregoing, such as directives to start and stop output, identify the
intended output device, or place URL hyperlinks in supported output
formats.

@node Separation, Argument Units, Language Concepts, Language Concepts
@subsubsection Separation

@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} output has strange requirements regarding
whitespace.  The @code{gtroff} output parser, however, is more tolerant,
making whitespace maximally optional.  Such characters, i.e., the tab,
space, and newline, always have a syntactical meaning.  They are never
printable because spacing within the output is always done by
positioning commands.

Any sequence of space or tab characters is treated as a single
@dfn{syntactical space}.  It separates commands and arguments, but is
only required when there would occur a clashing between the command code
and the arguments without the space.  Most often, this happens when
variable-length command names, arguments, argument lists, or command
clusters meet.  Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length need
not be separated by syntactical space.

A line break is a syntactical element, too.  Every command argument can
be followed by whitespace, a comment, or a newline character.  Thus a
@dfn{syntactical line break} is defined to consist of optional
syntactical space that is optionally followed by a comment, and a
newline character.

The normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a single
letter taking a fixed number of arguments.  For historical reasons, the
parser allows stacking of such commands on the same line, but
fortunately, in @code{gtroff}'s intermediate output, every command with
at least one argument is followed by a line break, thus providing
excellent readability.

The other commands---those for drawing and device controlling---have a
more complicated structure; some recognize long command names, and some
take a variable number of arguments.  So all @samp{D} and @samp{x}
commands were designed to request a syntactical line break after their
last argument.  Only one command, @w{@samp{x X}}, has an argument that
can span several input lines; all other commands must have all of
their arguments on the same line as the command, i.e., the arguments may
not be split by a line break.

Empty lines (these are lines containing only space and/or a comment),
can occur everywhere.  They are just ignored.

@node Argument Units, Document Parts, Separation, Language Concepts
@subsubsection Argument Units

Some commands take integer arguments that are assumed to represent
values in a measurement unit, but the letter for the corresponding scale
indicator is not written with the output command arguments.  Most
commands assume the scaling indicator @samp{u}, the basic unit of the
device, some use @samp{z}, the scaled point unit of the device, while
others, such as the color commands, expect plain integers.

Single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the names of
fonts and special characters.  The names of characters and fonts can be
of arbitrary length.  A character that is to be printed is always in
the current font.

A string argument is always terminated by the next whitespace character
(space, tab, or newline); an embedded @samp{#} character is regarded as
part of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment command.  An
integer argument is already terminated by the next non-digit character,
which then is regarded as the first character of the next argument or
command.

@node Document Parts,  , Argument Units, Language Concepts
@subsubsection Document Parts

A correct intermediate output document consists of two parts, the
@dfn{prologue} and the @dfn{body}.

The task of the prologue is to set the general device parameters using
three exactly specified commands.  @code{gtroff}'s prologue is
guaranteed to consist of the following three lines (in that order):

@Example
x T @var{device}
x res @var{n} @var{h} @var{v}
x init
@endExample

@noindent
with the arguments set as outlined in @ref{Device Control Commands}.
The parser for the intermediate output format is able to interpret
additional whitespace and comments as well even in the prologue.

The body is the main section for processing the document data.
Syntactically, it is a sequence of any commands different from the ones
used in the prologue.  Processing is terminated as soon as the first
@w{@samp{x stop}} command is encountered; the last line of any
@code{gtroff} intermediate output always contains such a command.

Semantically, the body is page oriented.  A new page is started by a
@samp{p} command.  Positioning, writing, and drawing commands are always
done within the current page, so they cannot occur before the first
@samp{p} command.  Absolute positioning (by the @samp{H} and @samp{V}
commands) is done relative to the current page; all other positioning is
done relative to the current location within this page.

every command can be terminated by a comment.
@end table

@node Simple Commands, Graphics Commands, Comment Command, Command Reference
@subsubsection Simple Commands

The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a
single character, taking a fixed number of arguments.  Most of them are
commands for positioning and text writing.  These commands are tolerant
of whitespace.  Optionally, syntactical space can be inserted before,
after, and between the command letter and its arguments.  All of these
commands are stackable; i.e., they can be preceded by other simple
commands or followed by arbitrary other commands on the same line.  A
separating syntactical space is only necessary when two integer
arguments would clash or if the preceding argument ends with a string
argument.

@table @code
@ignore
.if (\n[@USE_ENV_STACK] == 1) \{\
.command {
Open a new environment by copying the actual device configuration data
to the environment stack.
.

manipulated by the setting commands.
.
.
.command }
Close the actual environment (opened by a preceding
.BR { \~command)
and restore the previous environment from the environment
stack as the actual device configuration data.
.
\}              \" endif @USE_ENV_STACK
@end ignore

@item C @var{xxx}@angles{whitespace}
Print a special character named @var{xxx}.  The trailing syntactical
space or line break is necessary to allow glyph names of arbitrary
length.  The glyph is printed at the current print position; the glyph's
size is read from the font file.  The print position is not changed.

@item c @var{g}
Print glyph@tie{}@var{g} at the current print
position;@footnote{@samp{c} is actually a misnomer since it outputs a
glyph.} the glyph's size is read from the font file.  The print position
is not changed.

@item f @var{n}
Set font to font number@tie{}@var{n} (a non-negative integer).

@item H @var{n}
Move right to the absolute vertical position@tie{}@var{n} (a
non-negative integer in basic units @samp{u} relative to left edge of
current page.

@item h @var{n}
Move @var{n} (a non-negative integer) basic units @samp{u} horizontally
to the right.  The @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} manual allows negative
values for @var{n} also, but GNU @code{troff} doesn't use them.

@item m @var{color-scheme} @r{[}@var{component} @dots{}@r{]}
Set the color for text (glyphs), line drawing, and the outline of
graphic objects using different color schemes; the analogous command
for the filling color of graphic objects is @samp{DF}.  The color
components are specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65535.  The
number of color components and their meaning vary for the different
color schemes.  These commands are generated by @code{gtroff}'s escape
sequence @code{\m}.  No position changing.  These commands are a
@code{gtroff} extension.

@table @code
@item mc @var{cyan} @var{magenta} @var{yellow}
Set color using the CMY color scheme, having the 3@tie{}color components
@var{cyan}, @var{magenta}, and @var{yellow}.

@item md
Set color to the default color value (black in most cases).  No
component arguments.

@item mg @var{gray}
Set color to the shade of gray given by the argument, an integer between
0 (black) and 65535 (white).

@item mk @var{cyan} @var{magenta} @var{yellow} @var{black}
Set color using the CMYK color scheme, having the 4@tie{}color
components @var{cyan}, @var{magenta}, @var{yellow}, and @var{black}.

@item mr @var{red} @var{green} @var{blue}
Set color using the RGB color scheme, having the 3@tie{}color components
@var{red}, @var{green}, and @var{blue}.
@end table

@item N @var{n}
Print glyph with index@tie{}@var{n} (a non-negative integer) of the
current font.  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item n @var{b} @var{a}
Inform the device about a line break, but no positioning is done by this
command.  In @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, the integer arguments @var{b}
and@tie{}@var{a} informed about the space before and after the current
line to make the intermediate output more human readable without
performing any action.  In @code{groff}, they are just ignored, but they
must be provided for compatibility reasons.

@item p @var{n}
Begin a new page in the output.  The page number is set to@tie{}@var{n}.
This page is completely independent of pages formerly processed even if
those have the same page number.  The vertical position on the output is
automatically set to@tie{}0.  All positioning, writing, and drawing is
always done relative to a page, so a @samp{p} command must be issued
before any of these commands.

@item s @var{n}
Set type size to @var{n}@tie{}scaled points (this is unit @samp{z}).
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} used the unit points (@samp{p}) instead.
@xref{Output Language Compatibility}.

@item t @var{xxx}@angles{whitespace}
@itemx t @var{xxx} @var{dummy-arg}@angles{whitespace}
Print a word, i.e., a sequence of characters @var{xxx} representing
output glyphs which names are single characters, terminated by a space
character or a line break; an optional second integer argument is
ignored (this allows the formatter to generate an even number of
arguments).  The first glyph should be printed at the current position,
the current horizontal position should then be increased by the width of
the first glyph, and so on for each glyph.  The widths of the glyphs are
read from the font file, scaled for the current type size, and rounded
to a multiple of the horizontal resolution.  Special characters cannot
be printed using this command (use the @samp{C} command for special
characters).  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension; it is only used
for devices whose @file{DESC} file contains the @code{tcommand} keyword
(@pxref{DESC File Format}).

@item u @var{n} @var{xxx}@angles{whitespace}
Print word with track kerning.  This is the same as the @samp{t} command
except that after printing each glyph, the current horizontal position
is increased by the sum of the width of that glyph and@tie{}@var{n} (an
integer in basic units @samp{u}).  This command is a @code{gtroff}
extension; it is only used for devices whose @file{DESC} file contains
the @code{tcommand} keyword (@pxref{DESC File Format}).

@item V @var{n}
Move down to the absolute vertical position@tie{}@var{n} (a non-negative
integer in basic units @samp{u}) relative to upper edge of current page.

@item v @var{n}
Move @var{n}@tie{}basic units @samp{u} down (@var{n} is a non-negative
integer).  The @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} manual allows negative values
for @var{n} also, but GNU @code{troff} doesn't use them.

@item w
Describe an adjustable space. This performs no action; it is present for
documentary purposes.  The spacing itself must be performed explicitly
by a move command.
@end table

@node Graphics Commands, Device Control Commands, Simple Commands, Command Reference
@subsubsection Graphics Commands

Each graphics or drawing command in the intermediate output starts with
the letter @samp{D}, followed by one or two characters that specify a
subcommand; this is followed by a fixed or variable number of integer
arguments that are separated by a single space character.  A @samp{D}
command may not be followed by another command on the same line (apart
from a comment), so each @samp{D} command is terminated by a syntactical
line break.

@code{gtroff} output follows the classical spacing rules (no space
between command and subcommand, all arguments are preceded by a single
space character), but the parser allows optional space between the
command letters and makes the space before the first argument optional.
As usual, each space can be any sequence of tab and space characters.

Some graphics commands can take a variable number of arguments.  In this
case, they are integers representing a size measured in basic units
@samp{u}.  The arguments called @var{h1}, @var{h2}, @dots{}, @var{hn}
stand for horizontal distances where positive means right, negative
left.  The arguments called @var{v1}, @var{v2}, @dots{}, @var{vn} stand
for vertical distances where positive means down, negative up.  All
these distances are offsets relative to the current location.

Each graphics command directly corresponds to a similar @code{gtroff}
@code{\D} escape sequence.  @xref{Drawing Requests}.

Unknown @samp{D} commands are assumed to be device-specific.  Its
arguments are parsed as strings; the whole information is then sent to
the postprocessor.

In the following command reference, the syntax element @angles{line
break} means a syntactical line break as defined above.

@table @code
@item D~ @var{h1} @var{v1} @var{h2} @var{v2} @dots{} @var{hn} @var{vn}@angles{line break}
Draw B-spline from current position to offset (@var{h1},@var{v1}), then
to offset (@var{h2},@var{v2}), if given, etc., up to
(@var{hn},@var{vn}).  This command takes a variable number of argument
pairs; the current position is moved to the terminal point of the drawn
curve.

@item Da @var{h1} @var{v1} @var{h2} @var{v2}@angles{line break}
Draw arc from current position to
(@var{h1},@var{v1})@math{+}(@var{h2},@var{v2}) with center at
(@var{h1},@var{v1}); then move the current position to the final point
of the arc.

@item DC @var{d}@angles{line break}
@itemx DC @var{d} @var{dummy-arg}@angles{line break}
Draw a solid circle using the current fill color with
diameter@tie{}@var{d} (integer in basic units @samp{u}) with leftmost
point at the current position; then move the current position to the
rightmost point of the circle.  An optional second integer argument is
ignored (this allows the formatter to generate an even number of
arguments).  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item Dc @var{d}@angles{line break}
Draw circle line with diameter@tie{}@var{d} (integer in basic units
@samp{u}) with leftmost point at the current position; then move the
current position to the rightmost point of the circle.

@item DE @var{h} @var{v}@angles{line break}
Draw a solid ellipse in the current fill color with a horizontal
diameter of@tie{}@var{h} and a vertical diameter of@tie{}@var{v} (both
integers in basic units @samp{u}) with the leftmost point at the current
position; then move to the rightmost point of the ellipse.  This command
is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item De @var{h} @var{v}@angles{line break}
Draw an outlined ellipse with a horizontal diameter of@tie{}@var{h} and
a vertical diameter of@tie{}@var{v} (both integers in basic units
@samp{u}) with the leftmost point at current position; then move to the
rightmost point of the ellipse.

@item DF @var{color-scheme} @r{[}@var{component} @dots{}@r{]}@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects using different color schemes;
the analogous command for setting the color of text, line graphics, and
the outline of graphic objects is @samp{m}.  The color components are
specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65535.  The number of color
components and their meaning vary for the different color schemes.
These commands are generated by @code{gtroff}'s escape sequences
@samp{\D'F @dots{}'} and @code{\M} (with no other corresponding
graphics commands).  No position changing.  This command is a
@code{gtroff} extension.

@table @code
@item DFc @var{cyan} @var{magenta} @var{yellow}@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the CMY color scheme,
having the 3@tie{}color components @var{cyan}, @var{magenta}, and
@var{yellow}.

@item DFd@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects to the default fill color value
(black in most cases).  No component arguments.

@item DFg @var{gray}@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects to the shade of gray given by
the argument, an integer between 0 (black) and 65535 (white).

@item DFk @var{cyan} @var{magenta} @var{yellow} @var{black}@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the CMYK color scheme,
having the 4@tie{}color components @var{cyan}, @var{magenta},
@var{yellow}, and @var{black}.

@item DFr @var{red} @var{green} @var{blue}@angles{line break}
Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the RGB color scheme,
having the 3@tie{}color components @var{red}, @var{green}, and
@var{blue}.
@end table

@item Df @var{n}@angles{line break}
The argument@tie{}@var{n} must be an integer in the range @math{-32767}
to 32767.

@table @asis
@item @math{0 @leq{} @var{n} @leq{} 1000}
Set the color for filling solid drawing objects to a shade of gray,
where 0 corresponds to solid white, 1000 (the default) to solid black,
and values in between to intermediate shades of gray; this is obsoleted
by command @samp{DFg}.

@item @math{@var{n} < 0} or @math{@var{n} > 1000}
Set the filling color to the color that is currently being used for the
text and the outline, see command @samp{m}.  For example, the command
sequence

@Example
mg 0 0 65535
Df -1

No position changing.  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item Dl @var{h} @var{v}@angles{line break}
Draw line from current position to offset (@var{h},@var{v}) (integers in
basic units @samp{u}); then set current position to the end of the drawn

@item Dp @var{h1} @var{v1} @var{h2} @var{v2} @dots{} @var{hn} @var{vn}@angles{line break}
Draw a polygon line from current position to offset (@var{h1},@var{v1}),
from there to offset (@var{h2},@var{v2}), etc., up to offset
(@var{hn},@var{vn}), and from there back to the starting position.  For
historical reasons, the position is changed by adding the sum of all
arguments with odd index to the actual horizontal position and the even
ones to the vertical position.  Although this doesn't make sense it is

@item DP @var{h1} @var{v1} @var{h2} @var{v2} @dots{} @var{hn} @var{vn}@angles{line break}
Draw a solid polygon in the current fill color rather than an outlined
polygon, using the same arguments and positioning as the corresponding
@samp{Dp} command.
@ignore
No position changing.

This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item Dt @var{n}@angles{line break}
Set the current line thickness to@tie{}@var{n} (an integer in basic

smallest available line thickness; if @math{@var{n}<0} set the line
thickness proportional to the type size (this is the default before the
first @samp{Dt} command was specified).  For historical reasons, the
horizontal position is changed by adding the argument to the actual
horizontal position, while the vertical position is not changed.
Although this doesn't make sense it is kept for compatibility.

No position changing.

@node Device Control Commands, Obsolete Command, Graphics Commands, Command Reference
@subsubsection Device Control Commands

Each device control command starts with the letter @samp{x}, followed by
a space character (optional or arbitrary space or tab in @code{gtroff})
and a subcommand letter or word; each argument (if any) must be preceded
by a syntactical space.  All @samp{x} commands are terminated by a
syntactical line break; no device control command can be followed by
another command on the same line (except a comment).

The subcommand is basically a single letter, but to increase
readability, it can be written as a word, i.e., an arbitrary sequence of
characters terminated by the next tab, space, or newline character.  All
characters of the subcommand word but the first are simply ignored.  For
example, @code{gtroff} outputs the initialization command @w{@samp{x i}}
as @w{@samp{x init}} and the resolution command @w{@samp{x r}} as
@w{@samp{x res}}.

In the following, the syntax element @angles{line break} means a
syntactical line break (@pxref{Separation}).

@table @code
@item xF @var{name}@angles{line break}
The @samp{F} stands for @var{Filename}.

Use @var{name} as the intended name for the current file in error
reports.  This is useful for remembering the original file name when
@code{gtroff} uses an internal piping mechanism.  The input file is not
changed by this command.  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item xf @var{n} @var{s}@angles{line break}
The @samp{f} stands for @var{font}.

Mount font position@tie{}@var{n} (a non-negative integer) with font
named@tie{}@var{s} (a text word).  @xref{Font Positions}.

@item xH @var{n}@angles{line break}
The @samp{H} stands for @var{Height}.

Set glyph height to@tie{}@var{n} (a positive integer in scaled points
@samp{z}).  @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} uses the unit points (@samp{p})
instead.  @xref{Output Language Compatibility}.

@item xi@angles{line break}
The @samp{i} stands for @var{init}.

Initialize device.  This is the third command of the prologue.

@item xp@angles{line break}
The @samp{p} stands for @var{pause}.

Parsed but ignored.  The @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} manual documents
this command as

@display
pause device, can be restarted
@end display

but GNU @code{troff} output drivers do nothing with this command.

@item xr @var{n} @var{h} @var{v}@angles{line break}
The @samp{r} stands for @var{resolution}.

Resolution is@tie{}@var{n}, while @var{h} is the minimal horizontal
motion, and @var{v} the minimal vertical motion possible with this
device; all arguments are positive integers in basic units @samp{u} per
inch.  This is the second command of the prologue.

@item xS @var{n}@angles{line break}
The @samp{S} stands for @var{Slant}.

Set slant to@tie{}@var{n} (an integer in basic units @samp{u}).

@item xs@angles{line break}
The @samp{s} stands for @var{stop}.

Terminates the processing of the current file; issued as the last
command of any intermediate @code{troff} output.

@item xt@angles{line break}
The @samp{t} stands for @var{trailer}.

Generate trailer information, if any.  In GNU @code{troff}, this is
ignored.

@item xT @var{xxx}@angles{line break}
The @samp{T} stands for @var{Typesetter}.

Set the name of the output driver to @var{xxx}, a sequence of
non-whitespace characters terminated by whitespace.  The possible names
correspond to those of @code{groff}'s @option{-T} option.  This is the
first command of the prologue.

@item xu @var{n}@angles{line break}
The @samp{u} stands for @var{underline}.

Configure underlining of spaces.  If @var{n} is@tie{}1, start
underlining of spaces; if @var{n} is@tie{}0, stop underlining of spaces.
This is needed for the @code{cu} request in @code{nroff} mode and is
ignored otherwise.  This command is a @code{gtroff} extension.

@item xX @var{anything}@angles{line break}
The @samp{x} stands for @var{X-escape}.

Send string @var{anything} uninterpreted to the device.  If the line
following this command starts with a @samp{+} character this line is
interpreted as a continuation line in the following sense.  The @samp{+}
is ignored, but a newline character is sent instead to the device, the
rest of the line is sent uninterpreted.  The same applies to all
following lines until the first character of a line is not a @samp{+}
character.  This command is generated by the @code{gtroff} escape
sequence @code{\X}.  The line-continuing feature is a @code{gtroff}
extension.
@end table

@node Obsolete Command,  , Device Control Commands, Command Reference
@subsubsection Obsolete Command
In @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} output, the writing of a single glyph is
mostly done by a very strange command that combines a horizontal move
and a single character giving the glyph name.  It doesn't have a command
code, but is represented by a 3-character argument consisting of exactly
2@tie{}digits and a character.

@table @asis
@item @var{dd}@var{g}
Move right @var{dd} (exactly two decimal digits) basic units @samp{u},
then print glyph@tie{}@var{g} (represented as a single character).

In GNU @code{troff}, arbitrary syntactical space around and within this
command is allowed.  Only when a preceding command on the same line ends
with an argument of variable length is a separating space obligatory.
In @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}, large clusters of these and other
commands are used, mostly without spaces; this made such output almost
unreadable.
@end table

For modern high-resolution devices, this command does not make sense
because the width of the glyphs can become much larger than two decimal
digits.  In @code{gtroff}, this is only used for the devices @code{X75},
@code{X75-12}, @code{X100}, and @code{X100-12}.  For other devices, the
commands @samp{t} and @samp{u} provide a better functionality.

@item Low-resolution device @code{latin1}

This is similar to the high-resolution device except that the
positioning is done at a minor scale.  Some comments (lines starting
with @samp{#}) were added for clarification; they were not generated by
the formatter.

@item @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} output
Since a computer monitor has a much lower resolution than modern
printers, the intermediate output for X11 devices can use the
jump-and-write command with its 2-digit displacements.

@example

@node Output Language Compatibility,  , Intermediate Output Examples, gtroff Output
@subsection Output Language Compatibility

The intermediate output language of @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} was
first documented in @cite{A Typesetter-independent TROFF}, by Brian
Kernighan, and by 1992 the @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} manual was
updated to incorprate a description of it.

The GNU @code{troff} intermediate output format is compatible with this
specification except for the following features.

@itemize @bullet
@item
The classical quasi-device independence is not yet implemented.

@item
The old hardware was very different from what we use today.  So the
@code{groff} devices are also fundamentally different from the ones
in @acronym{AT&T} @code{troff}.  For example, the @acronym{AT&T}
PostScript device is called @code{post} and has a resolution of only 720
units per inch, suitable for printers 20 years ago, while @code{groff}'s
@code{ps} device has a resolution of 72000 units per inch.  Maybe, by
implementing some rescaling mechanism similar to the classical
quasi-device independence, @code{groff} could emulate @acronym{AT&T}'s
@code{post} device.

@item
The B-spline command @samp{D~} is correctly handled by the intermediate
output parser, but the drawing routines aren't implemented in some of
the postprocessor programs.

@item
The argument of the commands @samp{s} and @w{@samp{x H}} has the
implicit unit scaled point @samp{z} in @code{gtroff}, while
@acronym{AT&T} @code{troff} has point (@samp{p}).  This isn't an
incompatibility but a compatible extension, for both units coincide for
all devices without a @code{sizescale} parameter in the @file{DESC}
file, including all postprocessors from @acronym{AT&T} and
@code{groff}'s text devices.  The few @code{groff} devices with a
@code{sizescale} parameter either do not exist for @acronym{AT&T}
@code{troff}, have a different name, or seem to have a different
resolution.  So conflicts are very unlikely.

@item
The position changing after the commands @samp{Dp}, @samp{DP}, and
@samp{Dt} is illogical, but as old versions of @code{gtroff} used this
feature it is kept for compatibility reasons.

@ignore
Temporarily, there existed some confusion on the positioning after the
@samp{D} commands that are @code{groff} extensions.  This has been
clarified by establishing the classical rule for all @code{groff}
drawing commands:

@itemize
@item
The position after a graphic object has been drawn is at its end; for
circles and ellipses, the `end' is at the right side.

@item
From this, the positionings specified for the drawing commands above
follow quite naturally.

@section Device and Font Description Files
@cindex font files
@cindex files, font

The @code{groff} font and output device description formats are slight
extensions of those used by @acronym{AT&T} device-independent
@code{troff}.  In distinction to the @acronym{AT&T} implementation,
@code{groff} lacks a binary format; all files are text
files.@footnote{Plan@tie{}9 @code{troff} has also abandoned the binary
format.}  The device and font description files for a device @var{name}
are stored in a @file{dev@var{name}} directory.  The device description
file is called @file{DESC}, and, for each font supported by the device,
a font description file is called@tie{}@file{@var{f}}, where
@var{f}@tie{}is usually an abbreviation of a font's name and/or style.
For example, the @code{ps} (PostScript) device has @code{groff} font
description files for Times roman (@file{TR}) and Zapf Chancery Medium
italic (@file{ZCMI}), among many others, while the @code{utf8} device
(for terminal emulators) has only font descriptions for the roman,
italic, bold, and bold-italic styles (@file{R}, @file{I}, @file{B}, and
@file{BI}, respectively).

Device and font description files are read both by the formatter, GNU
@code{troff}, and by output drivers.  The programs delegate these files'
processing to an internal library, @file{libgroff}, ensuring their
consistent interpretation.

(2) the @code{charset} directive must come last (if at all).  If a

(deprecated: use @code{papersize} instead).

@item papersize @var{format-or-dimension-pair-or-file-name} @r{@dots{}}
@kindex papersize
The dimensions of the output medium are as according to the
argument, which is either a standard paper format, a pair of dimensions,
or the name of a plain text file containing either of the foregoing.

Recognized paper formats are the ISO and DIN formats
@code{A0}--@code{A7}, @code{B0}--@code{B7}, @code{C0}--@code{C7},
@code{D0}--@code{D7}; the U.S.@: paper types @code{letter},
@code{legal}, @code{tabloid}, @code{ledger}, @code{statement}, and
@code{executive}; and the envelope formats @code{com10}, @code{monarch},
and @code{DL}.  Matching is performed without regard for lettercase.

Alternatively, the argument can be a custom paper size in the format
@code{@var{length},@var{width}} (with no spaces before or after the
comma).  Both @var{length} and @var{width} must have a unit appended;
valid units are @samp{i} for inches, @samp{c} for centimeters, @samp{p}
for points, and @samp{P} for picas.  Example: @samp{12c,235p}.  An
argument that starts with a digit is always treated as a custom paper
format.

Finally, the argument can be a file name (e.g., @file{/etc/papersize});
if the file can be opened, the first line is read and a match attempted
against each of the other forms.  No comment syntax is supported.

More than one argument can be specified;
each is scanned in turn and the first valid paper specification used.

@subsection Font Description File Format
@cindex font file, format
@cindex font description file, format
@cindex format of font files
@cindex format of font description files

On typesetting output devices, each font is typically available at
multiple sizes.  While paper size measurements in the device description
file are in absolute units, measurements applicable to fonts must be
proportional to the type size.  @code{groff} achieves this using the
precedent set by @acronym{AT&T} device-independent @code{troff}: one
font size is chosen as a norm, and all others are scaled linearly
relative to that basis.  The ``unit width'' is the number of basic units
per point when the font is rendered at this nominal size.

For instance, @code{groff}'s @code{lbp} device uses a @code{unitwidth}
of@tie{}800.  Its Times roman font @samp{TR} has a @code{spacewidth}
of@tie{}833; this is also the width of its comma, period, centered
period, and mathematical asterisk, while its @samp{M} is 2,963 basic
units.  Thus, an @samp{M} on the @code{lbp} device is 2,963 basic units
wide at a notional type size of 800@tie{}points.@footnote{800-point type
is not practical for most purposes, but using it enables the quantities
in the font description files to be expressed as integers.}

A font description file has two sections.  The first is a sequence of
directives, and is parsed similarly to the @file{DESC} file described
above.  Except for the directive names that begin the second section,
their ordering is immaterial.  Later directives of the same name
override earlier ones, spaces and tabs are handled in the same way,
@cindex comments in font description files
@cindex font description files, comments
@kindex #
and the same comment syntax is supported.  Empty lines are ignored
throughout.

@table @code
@item name @var{f}
@kindex name
The name of the font is@tie{}@var{f}.  @samp{DESC} is an invalid font
name.  Simple integers are valid, but their use is
discouraged.@footnote{@code{groff} requests and escape sequences
interpret non-negative font names as mounting positions instead.
Further, a font named @samp{0} cannot be automatically mounted by the
@code{fonts} directive of a @file{DESC} file.}

@item spacewidth @var{n}
@kindex spacewidth
The width of an unadjusted inter-word space is @var{n}@tie{}basic units.

The directives above must appear in the first section; those below are
optional.

@table @code
@item slant @var{n}

@item ligatures @var{lig1} @r{@dots{}} @var{lign} @r{[}0@r{]}
@kindex ligatures
Glyphs @var{lig1}, @dots{}, @var{lign} are ligatures; possible ligatures
are @samp{ff}, @samp{fi}, @samp{fl}, @samp{ffi} and @samp{ffl}.  For
compatibility with other @code{troff} implementations, the list of
ligatures may be terminated with a@tie{}@code{0}.  The list of ligatures
must not extend over more than one line.

@item special

property.
@end table

Other directives in this section are ignored by GNU @code{troff}, but
may be used by postprocessors to obtain further information about the
font.

The second section contains one or two subsections.  These can appear in
either order; the first one encountered commences the second section.
Each starts with a directive on a line by itself.  A @code{charset}
subsection is mandatory unless the associated @file{DESC} file contains
the @code{unicode} directive.  Another subsection, @code{kernpairs},
is optional.

@kindex charset
The directive @code{charset} starts the character set
subsection.@footnote{For typesetter devices, this directive is misnamed
since it starts a list of glyphs, not characters.}  It precedes a series
of glyph descriptions, one per line.  Each such glyph description
comprises a set of fields separated by spaces or tabs and organized as

corresponds to the @code{troff} input character@tie{}@var{c}.  If
@var{name} is a multi-character sequence not beginning with @code{\}, it
corresponds to the GNU @code{troff} special character escape sequence
@samp{\[@var{name}]}.  A name consisting of three minus signs,
@samp{---}, is special and indicates that the glyph is unnamed: such
glyphs can only be accessed by the @code{\N} escape sequence in
@code{troff}.  A special character named @samp{---} can still be defined
using @code{char} and similar requests.  The @var{name} @samp{\-}
defines the minus sign glyph.  Finally, @var{name} can be the
unbreakable one-sixth and one-twelfth space escape sequences, @code{\|}
and @code{\^} (``thin'' and ``hair'' spaces, respectively), in which
case only the width metric described below is interpreted; a font can
thus customize the widths of these spaces.
@c XXX: For exhaustivity purposes...you can define "\whatever", which
@c has to be accessed with \C'\\whatever' or \[\\whatever], but the
@c parser matches predefined escape sequences before looking up special
@c characters.  Most such definitions are inaccessible from the
@c language, because nearly every '\x', where 'x' is a Unicode basic
@c Latin character, is a predefined groff escape sequence.
@c
@c XXX: Commented out because the charXXX feature is very legacy, and as
@c noted below, discouraged in font description files.
@c
@c GNU @code{troff} supports 8-bit input characters; however some
@c utilities have difficulties with eight-bit characters.  For this
@c reason, there is a convention that the entity name @samp{char@var{n}}
@c is equivalent to the single input character whose code
@c is@tie{}@var{n}.  For example, @samp{char163} would be equivalent to
@c the character with code@tie{}163, which is the pounds sterling sign
@c in the ISO@tie{}@w{Latin-1} character set.  You shouldn't use
@c @samp{char@var{n}} entities in font description files since they are
@c related to input, not output.  Otherwise, you get hard-coded
@c connections between input and output encoding, which prevents use of
@c different (input) character sets.

The form of the @var{metrics} field is as follows.

@display
@group
@var{width}[@code{,}[@var{height}[@code{,}[@var{depth}[@code{,}[@var{italic-correction}
  [@code{,}[@var{left-italic-correction}[@code{,}[@var{subscript-correction}]]]]]]]]]]
@end group
@end display

@noindent
There must not be any spaces, tabs, or newlines between these subfields
(it has been split here into two lines only for better legibility).  The
subfields are in basic units expressed as decimal integers.  Missing
subfields are assumed to be@tie{}@code{0}.  Since there is no associated
binary format, these values are not required to fit into the C language
data type @samp{char} as they are in @acronym{AT&T} device-independent
@code{troff}.

The @var{width} subfield gives the width of the glyph.  The @var{height}
subfield gives the height of the glyph (upward is positive); if a glyph
does not extend above the baseline, it should be given a zero height,
rather than a negative height.  The @var{depth} subfield gives the depth
of the glyph, that is, the distance below the baseline to which the
glyph extends (downward is positive); if a glyph does not extend below
the baseline, it should be given a zero depth, rather than a negative
depth.  Italic corrections are relevant to glyphs in italic or oblique
styles.  The @var{italic-correction} is the amount of space that should
be added after an oblique glyph to be followed immediately by an upright
glyph.  The @var{left-italic-correction} is the amount of space that
should be added before an oblique glyph to be preceded immediately by an
upright glyph.  The @var{subscript-correction} is the amount of space
that should be added after an oblique glyph to be followed by a
subscript; it should be less than the italic correction.

For fonts used with typesetting devices, the @var{type} field gives a
featural description of the glyph: it is a bit mask recording whether
the glyph is an ascender, descender, both, or neither.  When a @code{\w}
escape sequence is interpolated, these values are bitwise or-ed
together for each glyph and stored in the @code{nr} register.  In font
descriptions for @code{nroff}-mode output devices (terminals), all
glyphs might have a type of zero.

@table @code
@item 0
means the glyph lies entirely between the baseline and a horizontal line
at the ``x-height'' of the font; typical examples are @samp{a},
@samp{c}, and @samp{x};

@item 1
means the glyph descends below the baseline, like @samp{p};

@item 2
means the glyph ascends above the font's x-height, like @samp{A} or
@samp{b}; and

@item 3
means the glyph is both an ascender and a descender---this is true of
parentheses in some fonts.
@end table

The @var{code} field gives a numeric identifier that the postprocessor
uses to render the glyph.  The glyph can be specified to @code{troff}
using this code by means of the @code{\N} escape sequence.  @var{code}
can be any integer.@footnote{that is, any integer parsable by the C
standard library's @code{strotol} function}

The @var{entity-name} field defines an identifier for the glyph that the
postprocessor uses to print the GNU @code{troff} glyph @var{name}.  This
field is optional; it was introduced so that the @code{grohtml} output
driver could encode its character set.  For example, the glyph
@samp{\[Po]} is represented by @samp{&pound;} in @acronym{HTML} 4.0.
For efficiency, these data are now compiled directly into
@code{grohtml}.  @code{grops} uses the field to build sub-encoding
arrays for PostScript fonts containing more than 256 glyphs.  Anything
on the line after the @var{entity-name} field or @samp{--} is ignored.

A line in the @code{charset} section can also have the following format.

@Example
@var{name} "
@endExample

@noindent
This notation indicates that @var{name} is another name for the glyph
named on the preceding line.  Such aliases can be chained.

@kindex kernpairs
The word @code{kernpairs} starts a list of kerning adjustments to be
made to adjacent glyph pairs from this font.  It contains a sequence of
lines formatted as follows.

@Example
@var{g1} @var{g2} @var{n}
@endExample

@noindent
The foregoing means that when glyph @var{g1} is typeset immediately
before @var{g2}, the space between them should be increased
by@tie{}@var{n}.  Most kerning pairs should have a negative value
for@tie{}@var{n}.
@c END Keep parallel with groff_font(5).
