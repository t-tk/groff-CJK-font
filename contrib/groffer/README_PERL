README_PERL

'groffer' is written in the programming language Perl.


Compatibility

It was written in Linux, but due to Free Software under GNU it is
available for each operating system.

For testing, 'groffer.pl' may be used directly without a Makefile.  By
'make', this file will be transformed into the file 'groffer' that will
be installed.


Temporary files

The 'file' and 'so' temporaries are numbered and the files with .so
request are copied.  All .so requests are handled; this is an
extension to 'man' that deals only with the first .so request.
