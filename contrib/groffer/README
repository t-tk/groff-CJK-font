README

The 'groffer' program is the easiest way to read documents written in
some 'roff' language, such as the 'man pages', the manual pages in
many operating systems.  All 'roff' preprocessors, such as 'chem' or
'glilypond', are detected and executed automatically.


Input

Input comes from either standard input or command-line parameters that
represent names of exisiting roff files or standardized specifications
for searching man pages.  All of these can be compressed in a format
that is decompressible by 'gzip' or 'bzip2', including '.gz', 'bz2',
and '.Z'.

'groffer' has many built-in 'man' functionalities to find and read the
manual pages on Unix and similar operating systems.  It accepts the
information from an installed 'man' program, but tries to find a man
path by itself.

'groffer' bundles all filespec parameters into a single output file in
the same way as 'groff'.  The disadvantage of this is that all file
name arguments must use the same groff language.  To change this, the
option parsing must be revised for large parts.  It seems that this
would create incompatibilities, so the actual option strategy is kept.


Output

All input is first sent to 'grog' to determine the necessary 'groff'
command and then to 'groff' together with all necessary preprocessors.
So no special 'groff' arguments must be given.  But all 'groff'
options can be specified when this seems to be appropriate.

The following displaying modes for the output are available:
- Display formatted input with
-- a PDF viewer,
-- a Postcript viewer,
-- a web browser,
-- the X 'roff' viewer 'gxditview',
-- a DVI viewer,
-- a pager in a text terminal (tty).
- Generate 'groff' output on stdout without a viewer.
- Generate the 'groff intermediate output' on standard output without
  postprocessing.
- Output the source code without any 'groff' processing.
- There are some information outputs without 'groff' processing, such
  as by option '-V' and the 'man' like 'whatis' and 'apropos'
  outputs.

By default, the program creates a PDF file; on non-X text terminals,
the 'tty' text mode with a pager is tried by default.


File access

The Perl version of groffer now uses a umask of 077.  This is a very
strict security issue.  It allows only access of the temporary files
by the file owner.


Compatibility

'groffer' is compatible to the 'man' program.  It supports '.so'
requests based on the man path and compressed files.  That's more than
'groff' does.
