TODO
----

* Macro TOTC (Table Of Table Captions).

* Automatic recognition of the number of columns.

* Optional automatic calculation of the cell widths from the widths of the
  first line of the cell content instead of the explicit specification with
  the width argument.  This seems to be non-trivial without a preprocessor
  or additional external calls via .sy or .pso.

* Handling of pagebreaks in tables.

* Floating text left and/or right from tables.

* Converter hdtbl2html (awk, elisp, perl?); should be easy to write.

* Support for nroff.

* Support for -Thtml.
