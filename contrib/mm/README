This is mm, a macro package for groff.

It is supposed to be compatible with the Documenter's Workbench (DWB) mm
macros, and has several extensions.

Please submit bug reports using groff's 'BUG-REPORT' file to
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=groff.

Any new ideas or improvements are welcome.

This README should be bigger :-)
