This is mm, a macro package for groff.

It is supposed to be compatible with the DWB mm macros,
and has several extensions.

Submit bug reports at http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=groff with a
description of the problem and a sample of text which reproduces the
error.

Don't forget to mention the version of mm (look in the beginning
of m.tmac) and the version of groff.

Any new ideas or improvements are welcome.

Newest version is available here or at the groff repository.
ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/groff/mm<something>.gz

You can install mm as a separate package without the configure in groff
with the following command:

make -f Makefile.sim install

This README should be bigger :-)
