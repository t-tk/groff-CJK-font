2021-09-13  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Factor document-specific bloat out of spdf.tmac

	* spdf.tmac: Reorganize; add many comments.
	(XN): Retained, but reimplemented, to serve as...
	(XH, XN): ...both of these; add callback hooks for...
	(XH-INIT, XN-INIT, XH-UPDATE-TOC): ...these; provide no-op stubs;
	factor out TOC collection code, delegating to XH-UPDATE-TOC.
	(opt*XN-N, opt*XN-S, opt*XN-X): Rename internal macros to...
	(de spdf:XH-N, de spdf:XH-S, de spdf:XH-X): ...these, respectively.
	(AN, @AN, IE, IS, LU, NN, PXREF, SAME-PAGE, XM): Delete; we do not
	require these; if users do, they should define their own.
	(pdf@toc): Delete internal macro; fold body into...
	(TC): ...this.

	* pdfmark.ms (XH-UPDATE-TOC): Implement callback; it is based on...
	(XN): ...original implementation of this, factored out of spdf.tmac,
	but with significant simplification, to remove unnecessary code.
	(XNVS1, XNVS2, XNVS3): Tighten vertical spacing.

2021-09-04  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	(nh*hl): ...this s.tmac internal numeric register.
	(XN): Use \n[.NH] instead of \n[nh*hl].

2021-09-03  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Sanitize text for use in PDF document outlines.

	* sanitize.tmac: New file; it implements...
	(sanitize): ...this new macro; interprets its first argument as a
	string name, and copies its remaining arguments to the named string,
	discarding specific embedded troff escape sequences; currently...
	(\F): ...only this is identified as "specifically discardable".

	* pdfmark.am (TMACFILES): Add sanitize.tmac

	* spdf.tmac (mso): Include sanitize.tmac
	(xn*ref, xn*argc): Rename all occurrences...

	(spdf:bm.define): ...this new macro; passed the original $* from
	XN, this itself, is locally defined as a redirectable alias for...
	(spdf:bm.basic): ...this new local macro; it simply copies $*,
	passed from XN, to the string named by its first argument, (which is
	always spdf:bm.text), so reproducing previous behaviour.
	(opt*XN-S): New macro; defined for internal use only, it adds a "-S"
	option to XN, such that, when specified, it temporarily redirects...
	(spdf:bm.define): ...this macro mapping alias to...

	punctuation, below the superscript.  Use each as required.

2021-08-21  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Prefer "-ize" to "-ise" where etymology permits.

2020-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* pdfmark.am (PDFROFF): Call pdfroff without
	`--keep-temporary-files` option.  Temporary directories are
	created with mktemp(1) and files with an embedded process
	identifier, which frustrates reproducible builds.

	See <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?57218>.

2018-02-28  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* pdfmark.am (pdfmark.pdf): Use $(GROFF_V).

2018-02-28  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

2015-04-03  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	* pdfroff.man: Make it work in compatibility mode.

2014-10-14  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Deduce "--no-toc-relocation" from input stream (revisited).

	* pdfroff.sh (WRKFILE): Correct malformed sed expression.

	* spdf.tmac (TC): Prefer value of pdfroff's PHASE register to defined
	state of pdf:href.map, when choosing to emit control record to...
	(toc_relocation): ...enable this.

2014-10-13  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Deduce "--no-toc-relocation" from input stream.

	* pdfroff.sh (WRKFILE): Scan it for "pdfroff-option:set" records;
	apply settings; check for equivalent of "--no-toc-relocation" option.

	* spdf.tmac (TC): Emit "pdfroff-option:set toc-relocation=enabled".

2014-10-12  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Avoid spurious user visible control messages on stderr.

	* pdfroff.sh (REFCOPY): Ensure that at least one pdfhref mark of type
	'Z' will remain in the reference map, after all references have been
	resolved; this is required, to suppress writing of reference control
	records to stderr during the final PDF output processing phase.

2014-09-04  Bernd Warken  <groff-bernd.warken-72@web.de>

	* all pdfmark source files: Copying (remove last updates and
	replace years with package years) and Emacs setup.

2014-03-30  Steffen Nurpmeso  <sdaoden@yandex.com>

	* Makefile.sub: Put straight error-prevention prefixes for `rm'.

2014-03-29  Steffen Nurpmeso  <sdaoden@yandex.com>

	* Makefile.sub: Handle examples separately, controlled by
	$(make{_,_install_,_uninstall_}examples).

2013-01-28  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	* pdfmark.tmac (pdfmark, pdf:composed): Use `\!' instead of `\X'.

	With the old pdfmark there are gaps between two of the lines, but
	with the new version they disappear.  The use of `.br' and `.in 0'
	is arbitrary any request which causes an implicit break could be
	used.  Two breaks together only produce one line break, but if there
	is an intervening `\X' then the second break finds the line buffer
	not empty and generates another line break.

	Using `\!' does alter the position of the pdfmark lines in the
	intermediate file sent to grops (the pdfmark lines are output
	immediately rather than being serialised through the output line
	processing), but this has no effect since the contents of the
	pdfmark line stay the same.  It is the contents which determine
	where bookmarks jump to not the position of the record in the input
	stream to grops.

	I initially used `.output', but hit a snag if a pdfbookmark occurs
	before the document starts to output (message saying to insert an
	explicit `.br'), this is quite likely for things like `.pdfinfo
	/Author' which occur at the top of the document.  So I'm using the
	`\!' escape.

2012-09-20  Werner LEMBERG  <wl@gnu.org>

	Simplify enviroment handling.

	Suggested by Ivan Shmakov <oneingray@gmail.com>.

	* Makefile.sub (PDFROFF): Don't use export.

2011-12-26  Mike Frysinger  <vapier@gentoo.org>

	Fix parallel build race failure.

	Sometimes building in parallel will fail in the pdfmark directory:

	  make[2]: Entering directory '.../contrib/pdfmark'
	  rm -f pdfroff
	  rm -f pdfmark.pdf
	  sed -f ... ./pdfroff.sh >pdfroff
	  ...; ./pdfroff ... pdfmark.ms >pdfmark.pdf
	  /bin/sh: ./pdfroff: Permission denied
	  chmod +x pdfroff
	  make[2]: *** [pdfmark.pdf] Error 126

	This is because the generated pdf files use the local generated
	pdfroff helper script, but they don't depend directly upon it, so
	make tries to create the two in parallel and randomly falls over.

	* Makefile.sub: Have all the .pdf files explicitly depend on the
	`pdfroff' helper script.

2010-12-23  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Update copyright notices; pdfmark.tmac bug-fix.

	* pdfmark.tmac: Update copyright notices.
	(pdf*href.mark.resolve): Avoid premature removal, by aliasing to...

	* pdfroff.man: Document it.

2008-12-28  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Avoid phantom line wrapping in pdfhref hot-spots.

	* pdfmark.tmac (pdf*href.mark.end): Emit hot-spot end markers within
	scope of `\Z', to prevent possible output line length overflow which
	may occur only in the layout computation passes, but not in the final
	output pass.  Problem observed and identified by Nick Stoughton; it
	causes some hot-spots to be displaced from their proper locations.

2007-04-11  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	Avoid stray newlines in folded pdfmark literal content.

	* pdfmark.tmac (pdf*pdfmark.dispatch.wrapped): New string; define it

	while accumulating literal content, in case folding is required.
	(pdf*pdfmark.dispatch) [pdf*pdfmark.dispatch.wrapped]: Add them.

2007-04-11  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>
