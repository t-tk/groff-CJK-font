various docheader elements in TYPEWRITE when DOCTYPE is DEFAULT or

---Fixed---

A superfluous blank, numbered page is being generated by COLLATE

Underlining of italic passages in PRINTSTYLE TYEPWRITE not spanning
pages.
---Fixed---

PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE depositing extra space on new pages above quotes
that span pages.
---Fixed---

MN doesn't accept OFF, QUIT, END, X, etc.
---Fixed---

are running down the same page, instead of the remainder being
collected and output on the next.
---Fixed---

MN sometimes erroneously dropping margin notes near the bottom of
a page, even when they'd fit.  (MN-shifted not being removed by
MN-top.)
---Fixed---

MN_INIT not accepting "" args for default values.
---Fixed---

Documentation for margin notes erroneously states that the first
(optional) argument can be either "ragged" or "symmetric".  S/b
"RAGGED" or "SYMMETRIC".
---Fixed---

Use of "" to tell MN_INIT to use the default for any specific
argument in the arg list broken.

---Fixed---

Version 1.3
===========

---Fixed---

Version 1.2-f
============

Multiple line subheads near page bottom sometimes printing one line
of subhead at page bottom, and subsequent lines on next page.

containing a T_MARGIN (set with T_MARGIN or PAGE), mom is performing
spacing adjustments as if the first line doesn't exist.
---Fixed---

Changes made to ALD and LS in version 1.2-c should not apply when
the document processing macros are used.  There is a significant
conflict with the internal use of ALD when the docheader is only
one line long (as, for example, when DOCTYPE is CHAPTER).
---Fixed, pending discovery of further conflicts---

Version 1.2-c
=============

Deferred footnotes not always being output, and groff complains
"ending diversion FN_OVERFLOW on exit."
---Fixed---

First .LS call after a top margin has been set (with .T_MARGIN

are output, or after PROCESS_FN_LEFTOVER/PROCESS_FN_IN_DIVER.
---Fixed---

COL_NEXT and COL_BREAK, when invoked during the last column on a
page, are overprinting the last column instead of breaking to a new
page when there are footnotes in the column.
---Fixed---

justified copy.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.8
=============

of the top margin of running text, <distance> is not respected and
bottom margin falls low.
---Fixed---

processing mode (i.e. just straightforward typesetting), outputs
nothing unless SMARQUOTES is invoked explicitly.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-c
===============

In document processing mode, docs that use *none* of the
docprocessing tags being ignored.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-b
===============

String tabs not picking up #L_MARGIN when #L_MARGIN not explicitly
set with L_MARGIN, PAPER or PAGE.
---Fixed---

Infinite loop when B_MARGIN is set lower than FOOTER_MARGIN during
doc processing.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6-a
===============

Mom partially broken when run with groff 1.19.1.  Don't know yet
what this is, whether bad coding in mom, or a problem with 1.19.1.
Only solution for now: run mom 1.1.6 with groff 1.18.
----Fixed---

Top margin of endnotes pages after the first endnotes page when
PRINTSTYLE is TYPEWRITE and endnotes single-spacing is turned on
falling one line too high.
---Fixed---

Version 1.1.6
=============

---Fixed---

.UNDERLINE_QUOTES in PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE not on by default as advertised.
---Fixed---

.TI not cooperating with other indent styles.
---Fixed---

.WS and .SS not cooperating.
---Fixed---

.RW and .EW not working.
---Fixed---

========================================================================

KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------

The indent macros from the typesetting macro set may not always
perform well in conjunction with the document processing macros,
especially when documents are set in columns.  Mostly, this is the
result of inadequate testing.  There are only so many "who'd want to
do this anyway?" scenarios I can think of on my own.

Epigraphs at the bottoms of page may sometimes run exactly one line
deeper than they should.  The alternative (from my point of view) is
to have them run 1 line shorter than they should.  The problem stems
from the fact the epigraphs are leaded differently than all other text,
and there's only so much adjusting that can be done with the whitespace
surrounding them to get them to bottom align.  Since stylistically,
epigraphs should never appear at the bottom of a page/column without at
least some running text beneath them in order to make sense of the role
they play in page layout, this not likely to be fixed for some time.
