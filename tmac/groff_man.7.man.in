Note to maintainers of this document: while it is desirable to bracket
material that differs between groff_man(7) and groff_man_style(7) as
tightly as possible to honor the Don't Repeat Yourself principle, in
GBR's opinion this maxim has limits.

Consider this ghastly example:

If no scaling indicator is given,
the
.I man
package assumes \(lqn\(rq\c
_ifstyle()dnl
; that is,
the width of a letter \(lqn\(rq in the font current when the macro is
called
(see section \(lqNumerical Expressions\(rq in
.IR groff (@MAN7EXT@))\c
_endif
\&.

These man pages serve multiple goals, one of which is to serve as a
model for good man page writing by people who examine their sources.

After processing by m4, both child pages in the above case will carry \c
escapes followed by text lines starting with punctuation one normally
does not find in that position (and in the case of the period, which has
to be protected from interpretation as a control line).

This is ugly, fragile, and unnecessary; all of these traits are
offensive to good pedagogy.

Consequently, it is better to repeat a small amount of material than
write a man page that looks like the output of docbook-to-man.

Each macro is described in a tagged paragraph.
.
Closely related macros,
such as
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE ,
are grouped together.
.
.
_ifstyle()dnl
.P
A macro call appears on a line starting with a dot (\(lq.\(rq),
followed by zero or more spaces and then the macro name.
.
Some macros accept arguments;
each such argument is separated from the macro name and any subsequent
arguments by one or more spaces.
.
A newline,
unless escaped
(see subsection \(lqPortability\(rq below),
terminates the macro call.
.
.
_endif()dnl
.P
_ifstyle()dnl
Optional macro arguments are indicated by surrounding them with square
brackets.
.
If a macro accepts multiple arguments,
those containing space \" or horizontal tab (in Plan 9 troff [only?])
characters must be double-quoted to be interpreted correctly.
.
_endif()dnl
An empty macro argument can be specified with a pair of double-quotes
(\(lq""\(rq),
but the
.I man
package is designed such that this should seldom be necessary.
_ifstyle()dnl
.
See section \(lqNotes\(rq below for examples of cases where better
alternatives to empty arguments in macro calls are available.
_endif()dnl
.
Most macro arguments are strings that will be output as text;
exceptions are noted.
.
.
_ifstyle()dnl
.P
Bear in mind that
.I groff
is fundamentally a programming system for typesetting.

Consequently,
the verb \(lqto set\(rq is frequently used below in the sense \(lqto

_endif()dnl
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Document structure macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
The highest level of organization of a man page is determined by this
group of macros.
.
.B .TH
(title heading) identifies the document as a man page and defines
information enabling its indexing by
.IR mandb (8)
or a similar tool.
.
Section headings
.RB ( .SH ),
one of which is mandatory and many of which are standardized,
facilitate quick location of relevant material by the reader and aid
the man page writer to discuss all essential aspects of the topic.
.
Subsection headings
.RB ( .SS )
are optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
controlled way.
.
Many technical discussions benefit from examples;
lengthy ones,
especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output from
the system,
are usefully bracketed by
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE .
.
When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand,
a region within a (sub)section can be manually inset within
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
macros.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TH " title section"\c
.RI " [" footer-middle ]\c
.RI " [" footer-inside ]\c
.RI " [" header-middle ]
Define the title of the man page as
.I title
and the section of the manual volume as
.IR section .
_ifstyle()dnl
.
This use of \(lqsection\(rq has nothing to do with the section headings
otherwise discussed in this page;
it arises from the organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix
manuals.
_endif()dnl
.
See
.IR man (1)
for details on the section numbers and suffixes applicable to your
system.
.
.I title
and
.I section
are positioned together at the left and right in the header line
(with
.I section
in parentheses immediately appended to
.IR title ).
.
.I footer-middle
is centered in the footer line.
.
The arrangement of the rest of the footer depends on whether
double-sided layout is enabled with the option
.BR \-rD1 .
.
When disabled (the default),
.I footer-inside
is positioned at the bottom left.
.
Otherwise,
.I footer-inside
appears at the bottom left on odd-numbered (recto) pages,
and at the bottom right on even-numbered (verso) pages.
.
The outside footer is the page number,
except in the continuous-rendering mode enabled by the option
.BR \-rcR=1 ,
in which case it is the
.I title
and
.IR section ,
as in the header.
.
.I header-middle
is centered in the header line.
.
If
.I section
is a simple integer between 1 and\~9 (inclusive),
or is exactly \(lq3p\(rq,
there is no need to specify
.IR header-middle ;
the macro package will supply text for it.
.
For HTML output,
headers and footers are completely suppressed.
.
.
.IP
Additionally,
this macro starts a new page;
the page number is reset to\~1
(unless the
.B \-rC1
option is given).
.
This feature is intended only for formatting multiple man pages.
.
.
.IP
A man page should contain exactly one
.B .TH
call at or near the beginning of the file,
prior to any other macro calls.
_ifstyle()dnl
.
.
.IP
By convention,
.I footer-middle
is the most recent modification date of the man page source document,
and
.I footer-inside
is the name and version or release of the project providing it.
_endif()dnl

.TP
.BR .SH " ["\c
.IR heading-text ]
Set
.I heading-text
as a section heading.
.
The text following
.B .SH
up to the end of the line,
or the text on the next input line if
.B .SH
is given no arguments,
is set with no indentation,
in bold
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF )
and,
on typesetter devices,
slightly larger than the base point size.
.
If the heading font
.B \[rs]*[HF]
is bold,
use of an italic style in
.I heading-text
is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
.
Additionally,
the left margin and indentation affecting subsequent text are reset to
their default values.
.
Text on input lines after
.I heading-text
is set as an ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
.
.IP
The content of
.I heading-text
and ordering of sections has been standardized by common practice,
as has much of the layout of material within sections.
.
For example,
a section called \(lqName\(rq or \(lqNAME\(rq must exist,
must be the first section after the
.B .TH
call,
and must contain only a line of the form
.RS \" Invisibly move left margin to current .IP indent.
.RS \" Now indent further, visibly.

Set
.I subheading-text
as a subsection heading indented between a section heading and an
ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
See subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below for the
indentation amount.
.
The text following
.B .SS
up to the end of the line,
or the text on the next input line if
.B .SS
is given no arguments,
is set in bold
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ).
.
If the heading font
.B \[rs]*[HF]
is bold,
use of an italic style in
.I heading-text
is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
.
Additionally,
the left margin and indentation affecting subsequent text are reset to
their default values.
.
Text on input lines after
.I subheading-text
is set as an ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).

.SS "Paragraph macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
An ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P )
_ifstyle()dnl
like this one
_endif()dnl
is set without a first-line indentation at the current left margin,
which by default is indented from the leftmost position of the output
device.
.
In man pages and other technical literature,
definition lists are frequently encountered;
these can be set as \(lqtagged paragraphs\(rq,
which have one
.RB ( .TP )
or more
.RB ( .TQ )
leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an additional indentation.
.
The indented paragraph
.RB ( .IP )
macro is useful to continue the indented content of a narrative started
with
.BR .TP ,
or to present an itemized or ordered list.
.
All paragraph macros break the output line at the current position.
.
If another paragraph macro has occurred since the previous
.B .SH
or
.BR .SS ,
they
(except for
.BR .TQ )
follow the break with a default amount of vertical space,
which can be changed by the deprecated
.B .PD
macro;
see subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below.
.
They also reset the point size and font style to defaults
.RB ( .TQ
again excepted);
see subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq below.

.BR .RE ,
is not.
.

.TP
.BR .TP " ["\c
.IR indent ]
Set a paragraph with a leading tag,
and the remainder of the paragraph indented.
.
The input line following this macro,
known as the
.IR tag ,
is printed at the current left margin.
.
Subsequent text is indented by
.IR indent ,
if specified,
and by a default amount otherwise;
see subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below.
.
.
.IP
If the tag is not as wide as the indentation,
the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,
at the applicable indentation,
and continues on the following lines.
.
Otherwise,
the descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the
tag.

The

macro package is limited in its font styling options,
offering only
.BR bold \~( .B ),
.I italic\c
.RB \~( .I ),
and roman.
.
Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.
.
The
.B .SM
and
.B .SB
macros set text in roman or bold,
respectively,
at a smaller point size;
these differ visually from regular-sized roman or bold text only on
typesetter devices.
.
It is often necessary to set text in different styles without
intervening space.
.
The macros
.BR .BI ,
.BR .BR ,
.BR .IB ,
.BR .IR ,
.BR .RB ,
and
.BR .RI ,
where \(lqB\(rq,
\(lqI\(rq,

italic,
and roman,
respectively,
set their odd- and even-numbered arguments in alternating styles,
with no space separating them.
_ifstyle()dnl

Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic,
conflicting traditions have arisen regarding which font styles should be
used to mark file or path names,
environment variables,
in-line literals,

The default point size and family for typesetter devices is 10-point

Use italics

and anywhere a parameter requiring replacement by the user is
encountered.
.
An exception involves variable text in a context that is already marked
up in italics,
such as file or path names with variable components;
in such cases,
follow the convention of mathematical typography:
set the file or path name in italics as usual
but use roman for the variable part

identifiers for standards documents or technical reports such as
CSTR\~#54,

POSIX.1-2017;
acronyms;
and occurrences after the first of a technical term or piece of jargon.
.
Again,
the names of operating systems and their kernels are,
by practically universal convention,
set in roman.
.
.
.P
Be frugal with italics for emphasis,
and particularly with bold.
.
Brief runs of literal text,
such as references to individual characters or short strings,
including section and subsection headings of man pages,
are suitable objects for quotation;
see the

Unlike the above font style macros,
the font style alternation macros below accept only arguments on the

It may be helpful to think of the left margin and indentation as related

The left margin is manipulated by
.B .RS

(and by
.\".BR .TH ,\" True but not to be encouraged within a document.
.B .SH

which reset it to the default).

The other kind of indentation is controlled by the paragraphing macros
(though,
again,
.\".BR .TH ,

reset it).
.
Indentation is imposed by the
.BR .TP ,
.BR .IP ,

macros,
and cancelled by
.B .P

An extensive example follows.

.P
This ordinary

paragraph is not in a relative inset nor does it possess an indentation.
.

Now we have created a relative inset

moved the left margin)

This tagged paragraph,
set with
.BR .TP ,
is still within the
.B .RS
region,
but lines after the first have a supplementary indentation that the
tag lacks.
.
.
.IP
A paragraph like this one,
set with
.BR .IP ,
will appear to the reader as also associated with the tag above,
because
.B .IP
re-uses the previous paragraph's indentation unless given an argument
to change it.
.
This paragraph is affected both by the moved left margin
.RB ( .RS )
and indentation
.RB ( .IP ).
.
.TS
box;
l.
This table is affected both by
the left margin and indentation.
.TE
.
.
.IP \(bu
This indented paragraph has a bullet for a tag,
making it more obvious that the left margin and the paragraph
indentation are distinct;
only the former affects the tag,
but both affect the text of the paragraph.
.
.
.P
This ordinary
.RB ( .P )
paragraph resets the indentation,
but the left margin is still inset.
.
.TS
box;
l.
This table is affected only
by the left margin.
.TE
.RE
.
.
.P
Finally,
we have ended the relative inset by using
.BR .RE ,
which
(because we only used one
.BR .RS / .RE
pair)
has reset the left margin to the default.
.
This is an ordinary
.B .P
paragraph.
.
.
.P
Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output with
horizontal tab characters or the indentation arguments to
.BR .IP ,
.BR .TP ,
.BR .RS ,
or the deprecated
.BR .HP ;
the result may not render comprehensibly on an output device you fail to
check,
or which is developed in the future.
.
The table preprocessor
.IR \%@g@tbl (@MAN1EXT@)
can likely meet your needs.
_endif()dnl

The following macros break the output line and insert vertical space:
.BR .SH ,
.BR .SS ,
.BR .TP ,
.B .P

The default inter-section and inter-paragraph spacing is
is 1v for terminal devices

When a preprocessor like

.SS Portability
.\" ====================================================================
.
The two major syntactical categories of
.I roff
languages are requests and escapes.
.
Since the
.I man
macros are implemented in terms of
.I groff
requests and escapes,
one can,
in principle,
supplement the functionality of
.I man
with these lower-level elements where necessary.
.
.
.P
However,
using raw
.I groff
requests
(apart from the empty request
.RB \(lq . \(rq)\&
is likely to make your page render poorly when processed by other tools;
many of these attempt to interpret page sources directly for conversion
to HTML.
.
Some requests make implicit assumptions about things like character
and page sizes that may not hold in an HTML environment;
also,
many of these viewers don't interpret the full
.I groff
vocabulary,
a problem that can lead to portions of your text being omitted
or presented incomprehensibly.
.
.
.P
For portability to modern viewers,
it is best to write your page entirely with the macros described in this
page
(except for the ones identified as deprecated,
which should be avoided).
.
The macros we have described as extensions
.RB ( .EX / .EE ,
.BR .SY / .YS ,
.BR .TQ ,
.BR .UR / .UE ,
and
.BR .MT / .ME )
should be used with caution,
as they may not yet be built in to some viewer that is important to your
audience.
.
See
.I an\-ext.tmac
in section \(lqFiles\(rq below.

.
.P
Similar caveats apply to escapes.
.
Some escape sequences are however required for correct typesetting
even in man pages and usually do not cause portability problems.
.
Several of these render glyphs corresponding to punctuation code points
in the Unicode basic Latin range
(U+0000\(enU+007F)
that are handled specially in
.I roff
input;
the escapes below must be used to render them correctly and portably
when documenting material that uses them syntactically\(emnamely,
any of the set

.SS History
.\" ====================================================================
.
Version\~7 Unix (1979) introduced the
.I man
macro package and supported all of the macros described in this page not
listed as extensions,
except
.BR .P ,
.BR .SB ,
.\" .SS was implemented in tmac.an but not documented in man(7).
and the deprecated
.B .AT
and
.BR .UC .
.
The only strings defined were
.B R
and
.BR S ;
no registers were documented.
.
.B .UC
appeared in 3BSD (1980) and
.B .P
in Unix System\~III (1980).
.
.\" This inference is based on RCS idents of "PWB Manual Entry Macros"
.\" from various forms of "an.src" distributed with System III (an.src
.\" 1.35, dated 5/6/80, lacks the Tm string), Version 10 Research Unix
.\" (1.36, dated 11/11/80, has it), Ultrix 3.1 (1.37, dated 12/19/80,
.\" retains it) and "pdp11v" (also 1.37).  One source (S. S. Pirzada)
.\" says PWB 2.0 was released in June 1979.  I found no record of later
.\" releases and cannot account for the discrepancy (field updates?).
.\" -- GBR
PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980) added the
.B Tm
string.
.
4BSD (1980) added
.\" undocumented .VS and .VE macros to mark regions with 12-point box
.\" rules (\[br]) as margin characters, as well as...
.B lq
and
.B rq
strings.
.
4.3BSD (1986) added
.\" undocumented .DS and .DE macros for "displays", which are .RS/.RE
.\" wrappers with filling disabled and vertical space of 1v before and
.\" .5v after, as well as...
.B .AT
and
.BR .P .
.
.\" Per Doug McIlroy in
.\" <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff/2019-07/msg00038.html>...
Version\~9 Research Unix (1986) introduced

.
SunOS\~4.0 (1988) may have been the first to support
.BR .SB .
.\" ...which appeared in a few man pages distributed in 4.3BSD-Reno and

.IP
In the title heading
.RB ( .TH ),
the date of the page's last revision is more important than packaging
information;
it should not be omitted.
.
Ideally,
a page maintainer will keep both up to date.
.
.
.IP
.B .IP
is sometimes ill-understood and misused,
especially when no marker argument is supplied\(eman indentation
argument is not required.
.
By setting an explicit indentation,
you may be overriding the reader's preference as set with the
.B \-rIN
option.
.
If your page renders adequately without one,
use the simpler form.
.
If you need to indent multiple (unmarked) paragraphs,
consider an setting an indented region with
.B .RS
and
.B .RE
instead.
.
.
.IP
In the last example,
the empty argument does have a subtly different effect than its
suggested replacement;
the empty argument causes an additional space character to be
interpolated between the arguments \(lqtwo\(rq and \(lqthree\(rq\(embut
it is a regular breaking space,
so it can be discarded at the end of an output line.
.
It is better not to be subtle,
particularly with space,
which can be overlooked in source and rendered forms.
.
.
.TP
.RB \(bu " .RS" " doesn't indent relative to my indented paragraph."
.
The
.B .RS
macro sets the left margin;
that is,
the position at which an
.I ordinary
paragraph
.RB ( .P
and its synonyms)
will be set.
.
.BR .RS ,
.BR .IP ,
.BR .TP ,
and the deprecated
.B .HP
all use the same default indentation.
.
To create an inset relative to an indented paragraph,
call
.B .RS
repeatedly until an acceptable indentation is achieved,
or give
.B .RS
an indentation argument that is at least as much as the paragraph's
indentation amount relative to an adjacent
.B .P
paragraph.
.
See subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq above for the
values.
.
.
.TP
.RB \(bu " .RE" " doesn't move the inset back to the expected level."

\(bu warning: number register \(aqan\-saved\-margin\c

.TQ
\(bu warning: number register \(aqan\-saved\-prevailing\-indent\c
.IR n "\(aq not defined"
.
The
.B .RS
macro takes an
.I indentation amount
as an argument;
the
.B .RE
macro's argument is a specific
.IR "inset level" .
.
.B .RE\~1
goes to the level before any
.B .RS
macros were called,
.B .RE\~2
goes to the level of the first
.B .RS
call you made,
and so forth.
.
If you desire symmetry in your macro calls,
simply issue one
.B .RE
without an argument
for each
.B .RS
that precedes it.
.
.
.IP
After calls to the
.B .SH
and
.B .SS
sectioning macros,
all relative insets are cleared and calls to
.B .RE
have no effect until
.B .RS
is used again.
.
.
.TP
\(bu Do I need to keep typing the indent in a series of \c
.BR .IP " calls?"
.
You don't need to if you don't want to change the indentation.
