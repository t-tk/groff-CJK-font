3) Documentation

groff documentation is spread throughout the tree; where possible, it is
close to the source code it describes.

- The top-level directory contains text files presenting groff as a
  software project, with its focus on organization of the code,
  development procedures, and project administration.

  If you don't know where to begin, start with "README"; it contains the
  information you will require to obtain the groff distribution archive,
  report bugs, and contact the developers.

- A man page for each program (for section 1 of the manual) is
  maintained in the source directory of the program itself.

- Extensive man pages documenting GNU roff's input language, special
  character repertoire, differences from AT&T troff, device and font
  description file formats, macro files, and historical and conceptual
  background are maintained in the "man" directory.

- Documentation in other formats is located in the "doc" directory,
  including groff's Texinfo manual, and tutorial and/or reference
  manuals written using groff macro packages.

- Documentation for contributed components is kept in the relevant
  subdirectory of "contrib".


4) groff language parser

The "troff" program in "src/roff/troff" parses the groff input language.
There, "input.cpp" implements the main loop and tokenizes input.  Input
tokens are transformed into nodes (a GNU troff internal data structure)
by "env.cpp" and "node.cpp".  Routines in the latter file generate the
page description language from lists of nodes.


5) page description language parser

The parser for the page description language produced by troff is
implemented in "src/libs/libdriver/input.cpp".  This is used by all
groff output drivers written in C++.  ("gropdf", written in Perl,
performs its own parsing.)
