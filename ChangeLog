	* doc/doc.am: Stop treating "gnu.eps" as an "example" file; it
	is also used by pdfmark's cover.ms, which is ordinary
	documentation.  We therefore must not omit it when building.
	(install-data-hook): Add dependency on new phony target,
	"install_doc_gnu_eps".
	(install_doc_examples): Move installation of "gnu.eps" from
	here...
	(install_doc_gnu_eps): ...to here.  Also refactor the loop we
	use to locate the file follow a more idiomatic pattern.

	* doc/doc.am (dist-info-bits, install_infodoc, dist-gnueps): Fix
	code style nit: use consistent "brace style" in conditionals and
	loops.

2022-04-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (mostlyclean_doc): When cleaning, try harder to
	remove the image directory created by the "pic.html" and
	"webpage.html" targets.

2022-04-02  Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* doc/doc.am: Stop installing doc/meintro.me.in,
	doc/meintro_fr.me.in, and doc/meref.me.in.

	* doc/webpage.ms: Die horribly if `PSPIC` call fails.

	* tmac/pspic.tmac (pspic*error-hook): Define (as empty).

2022-03-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*bookmark): Trivially refactor.  Now that
	we're no longer doing arithmetic on our first argument, simplify
	our definition.  Made possible by commit 3baf0e2f3, 23 February.

2022-03-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (detect_file_encoding): Demote
	an error diagnostic to a debugging message.  libuchardet has no
	man page, and inspecting the source of the
	`uchardet_handle_data` function we find that it effectively
	returns a Boolean value (if the result of a
	`reinterpret_cast`(!) is not `NS_OK`).  This is useless
	information for a user-facing tool.  We're designed to muddle on
	regardless (see preconv(1)).

	draw_dvi_printer::fill_next):
	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (output::put_color):

	doubles instead of casting to them.

2022-03-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[doc]: Refactor handling of "gnu.eps" file.

	* doc/doc.am: Put "gnu.eps" in a Make macro, `DOC_GNU_EPS`.
	($(PROCESSEDEXAMPLEFILES) $(PROCESSEDDOCFILES),
	doc/webpage.html, install_doc_examples): Migrate dependency to
	`DOC_GNU_EPS`.
	(doc/webpage.ps): Add (missing) dependency on `DOC_GNU_EPS`.
	(DOC_GROFF_ONLY): Drop `-I` flag; it's not necessary given the
	following.
	(.ms.ps): Drop `-mwww` argument from suffix rule.  A truly
	generic ms document won't need it.
	(doc/webpage.ps): Add target rule.  Include `-mwww` argument.
	(doc/webpage.ps, doc/webpage.html): Pass `-I` option to
	`DOC_GROFF` and `DOC_GROFF_ONLY` (respectively) to enable
	location of "gnu.eps" file.  Search the build and source trees'
	"doc" directories because the file can be generated as part of
	the build or can come with the distribution archive.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Drop redundant inclusion of "doc/gnu.xpm".
	(clean_maintdoc): Add phony target to dispose of `DOC_GNU_EPS`.
	(maintainer-clean-local): Depend on "clean_maintdoc".

	* tmac/tests/pdfpic_does-not-choke-on-bad-pdfinfo-output.sh:
	* tmac/tests/pdfpic_falls-back-to-PSPIC.sh: Update tests to look
	for "gnu.eps" in "doc" directory of build tree.  Give generated
	files distinguishable names so their tests can run concurrently.

2022-03-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Add new macro `PROCESSEDDOCFILES_PS` to isolate
	names of targets in PostScript format.  Expand this macro in
	definition of `PROCESSEDDOCFILES` and use it to move PostScript
	font description file dependencies of the latter and
	`PROCESSEDEXAMPLEFILES` to the former.  (At present, the
	dependency might seem superfluous, since those files are in the
	source distribution, but it's conceivable that in the near
	future, they will be produced at build time from Adobe font
	metric files; see font/devps/generate/Makefile).  The "pic.html"
	and "webpage.html" targets already had such a dependency because
	of the way grohtml (pre-grohtml) works.

2022-03-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* INSTALL.extra: Add a section on uninstalling.

2022-03-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Create target rule for "doc/grnexampl.ps" instead
	of relying on a suffix rule.  Explicitly depend on grn and eqn
	executables.  Produce output using their groff flags, "-ge".

2022-03-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac (PDFPIC): Fix breakage when no temporary
	directory environment variables are defined: actually use string
	interpolation syntax in comparand to output comparison
	operator.  Problem introduced by me in commits adc1999af and
	24900cf6d, 15 February.

	Automake variable for generated artifacts.  Problem introduced
	by me in commit 3c82cbbfe, 27 February.  Thanks to Robert
	Goulding for the report.

2022-03-22  Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* doc/doc.am: delete redundant "SUFFIXES +=" line

2022-03-22  Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* doc/doc.am: fix non-portable syntax in the meintro_fr.ps
	target: This rule requires DOC_GROFF and hence $<, so turn it
	into a suffix rule.

2022-03-22  Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* doc/doc.am: fix non-portable syntax in the doc/me*.me targets:
	POSIX does not define the meaning of $< in non-suffix rules, so
	use the portable $? instead.  This is adequate here because each
	of these three rules has exactly one prerequisite.

2022-03-22  Ingo Schwarze <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* doc/doc.am: fix non-portable syntax in the groff-man-pages.*
	targets by using DOC_GROFF_ONLY rather than DOC_GROFF in order
	to not use $< outside a suffix rule; DOC_GROFF functionality is
	not needed here in the first place.

2022-03-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac:
	* tmac/doc.tmac: Stop remapping input hyphens on `utf8` device.

2022-03-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/doc.tmac: Stop remapping ` and ' on `utf8` output device.
	Aligns mdoc(7) with commit 697e6db7f, 19 October 2020 (for
	man(7)).

2022-03-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Fix bug introduced in commit
	0d451902c, 10 March.  Don't store a newline in the version
	string.  Put `\n` in its interpolation context as necessary.

2022-03-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Install ptx.tmac.

	* tmac/tmac.am (TMACNORMALFILES): Add it.

2022-03-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Drop ditroff(7) document.  It says nothing that is not covered

2022-03-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[preconv]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp: Use diagnostic message
	functions from libgroff where possible.  Explain in a comment
	why we don't use `debug()`.  Boolify and rename some variables,
	and use Boolean literals to assign to them.
	  debug_flag         -> is_debugging
	  invalid_warning    -> emit_invalid_utf8_warning
	  incomplete_warning -> emit_incomplete_utf8_warning
	Rename `expected_bytes` to `expected_byte_count`.  Except for
	the debugging flag, these are all members of `struct
	conversion`.
	(get_tag_lines): Migrate to `warning()`.
	(detect_file_encoding): Migrate to `error()` and `fatal()`, as
	appropriate.
	(utf8::invalid, utf8::incomplete, get_tag_lines): Don't break a
	line in the middle of a diagnostic; doing so frustrates grepping
	and necessarily makes an assumption about the terminal width.

2022-03-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Rename global variable
	`have_string_arg` to `have_multiple_params` and demote it from
	an integer to a Boolean.  Assign Boolean literals to it.
	(read_long_escape_parameters, get_copy, token::next): Do it.

2022-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #62191.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (table_input::get): Increment input
	line counter when encountering an escaped newline; this fixes
	inaccurate diagnostics from the formatter at any point in a
	document after a line-continued row of table data.  Also drop a
	"perhaps" comment.  I tested the surmise (setting the FSM state
	to "START"), and it results in bad formatting.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62191>.  Problem appears
	to date back to groff 1.02 (June 1991) at the latest.

2022-03-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Regression-test Savannah #62191.

	* src/preproc/tbl/tests/count-continued-input-lines.sh: Do it.

2022-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (initialization): Define `@b` as empty if
	formatting for HTML, because no page breaks occur in that

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62039>.

2022-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/grodvi/dvi.cpp (usage): Align usage message with

	* src/devices/grodvi/dvi.cpp (main):

	(initialization): Define new strings, `an*body-family` and
	`an*example-family` to house the font families used in these
	rendering contexts.
	(TH, SH, SS): Restore the font family to `an*body-family`.
	(TH): Set font style to roman as well.
	(EX): Change to `an*example-family` instead of literal "C".

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62187>.

2022-03-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Test register for existence before using it to
	set hyphenation mode.  A site troffrc or other local
	customization might remove the register (which is guaranteed to
	be set under the stock configuration) and, perversely, Heirloom
	Doctools troff interprets a `do` request, instead of ignoring it
	as a historical troff implementation would, so if they borrow
	our me(7) changes, the register would be unset, interpolate
	zero, and hyphenation would wind up disabled.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62181>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the report.

2022-03-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2022-03-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (Input Line Traps): Fix error; input traps do
	_not_ ignore control lines.  Error appears to have crept in with
	the first version of our Texinfo manual, shipped with groff 1.14
	{December 1999}.

2022-03-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devps/devps.am: Rename targets.
	(fonts):
	(devps_fonts): Rename these...
	(maintainer-font-descriptions):
	(devps_font-descriptions): ...to these.  Add comments explaining
	what they're for and why they aren't used in a build.

	* font/devps/generate/Makefile: Add `outdir` variable to store
	destination directory of font description files, and update all
	targets that write artifacts to use this directory.  This makes
	the targets "phony", which I don't regard as a problem since the
	generated artifacts are kept under source control, and this
	isn't really a user-facing script (even though it gets
	installed).  I think there is a good chance that this will
	become a shell script, because to avoid regressions we need to
	generate the font descriptions using both the 229-glyph and
	314-glyph versions of the Adobe fonts' AFM files (so that we get
	wider glyph coverage _and_ more kerning pair data) and we need
	to add kerning information for the ellipsis (Savannah #58897).
	(symbolsl.afm): Revise generation process to be sensitive to
	failure.

2022-03-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devps/symbolsl.afm: New file.
	* font/devps/devps.am (EXTRA_DIST): We have long shipped
	"symbol.afm" with the distribution archive--I don't see why we
	don't ship "symbolsl.afm" and "zapfdr.afm" as well (metrics for
	`SS`, the slanted symbol font, and ZDR, reversed Zapf Dingbats).
	Like the Type 1 font descriptions themselves, this file is
	updated only in "maintainer mode", not as part of the build.
	Moreover, these fonts are not part of the PostScript level 2
	base 35 fonts so their AFM files are unlikely to be readily
	available elsewhere.

2022-03-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Trivially refactor.  Store the
	program's version string in scalar `afmtodit_version` and use
	that in the usage message and comment embedded in the output.

2022-03-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Fix code style nits.  Migrate
	to the shebang line style we use in more recently modified Perl
	scripts.  Replace `-w` with `use warnings;`.  Shorten an output
	comment since the groff version string can grow long (see commit
	1264531310, 14 January 2018).

2022-03-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.pl: Stop writing full file name to
	the generated font description file as the "name" (i.e., don't
	include directory components).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?62150>.  Thanks to Dave
	Kemper for the discussion and code review.

2022-03-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/afmtodit/afmtodit.1.man:

	synopsis, option descriptions, and command usage output.

2022-03-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/X.tmac: Redirect `fchar` requests for \[lq] and \[rq] to
	\[dq] since the X11 Type 1-based text fonts encode ISO 8859-1
	{Latin-1} and don't have typopgrapher's quotes.  Drop `fchar`
	request for \[aq], which _is_ represented, per recent changes.

	been wrong for a long time; we've had it in tty.tmac since James
	Clark put it there in 1992.)  Recast and tighten wording.  Drop
	the word "horizontal"; there is no vertical page offset (as
	such) in *roff.  Replace hand-waving about unexpected results
	with a description of the formatter's behavior.  Dcoument
	request behavior without an argument before getting into the
	weeds (and CSTR #54 errata).  Migrate terminology from "scaling
	indicator" to "scaling unit".

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_char_for_escape_name): Recast
	diagnostic messages to more accurately refer to escape
	"sequence" rather than "name".  "Name" is a confusing term here,
	given that it also applies to a group of objects sharing a name
	space (natch): requests, macros, strings, and diversions.
	Further, the "escape name" cited by these diagnostics is not the
	escape function selector; that is, the character after the
	escape character which determines how the escape sequence is to
	be interpreted.  These diagnostics are only thrown after that
	function is known, however, when parsing of an escape sequence
	parameter is attempted.
	(input_char_description): Drop leading articles ("a") from
	input character descriptions, to economize in diagnostic
	messages this function helps produce.

	messages to more consistently use the form "expected X, got Y"
	where feasible.

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (start_number): Say "numeric
	expression missing" instead of "missing number"; we don't
	require a terminal symbol in the expression grammar here.  Also
	use `tok.description()` where we can, and remove assumption that
	the escape character is the default.

	hypocritical.  Perhaps if we knew the correct CSS incantation

	Refactor X11 font description generation.  Integrate it with our
	"new" (post-2014) Automake-based build system.

	* src/utils/xtotroff/Makefile.in: Delete relic of old build
	system.  Also, it had a bug: it generated X11 output device
	'DESC' files with a "unitwidth 10" directive even for the "-12"
	devices, which is not correct (the in-tree DESC files we've been
	shipping for years were nevertheless correct, apparently fixed
	by hand by James Clark in groff 1.07 [March 1993]).

	* src/utils/xtotroff/xtotroff.am: Define `xtotroff` variable for
	use by X11 font description generation targets below.

	* font/devX100-12/devX100-12.am:
	* font/devX100/devX100.am:
	* font/devX75-12/devX75-12.am:
	* font/devX75/devX75.am: Add new (phony) targets, variously
	named "devX{100,100_12,75,75_12}", to generate the corresponding
	output device's DESC file and run xtotroff(1) to generate its
	font description files.  Be sure to set the correct "unitwidth"
	for the "-12" devices.  Add new dependency-only rule
	"maintainer-font-descriptions" depending on these new targets
	for convenience (and future expansion to devps and devlj4).

	* FOR-RELEASE: Document existence of
	"maintainer-font-descriptions" Make target and when to run it.

	Running this target with the aforementioned bug fix, overwriting
	the in-tree DESC and font description files using data gathered
	from a running X server, results in no changes whatsoever.  Say
	what you will about X11 core font technology--it's stable.

	Rename and ship "FontMap-X11".  xtotroff(1) is not very useful
	without a font name mapping file to read.  To date it has been
	available only in the source distribution.  Remedy that.  The
	file is placed directly in the groff font directory alongside
	the device directories because it applies to four different
	devices, and four copies of this data are not required.

	* src/devices/xditview/FontMap: Rename to...
	* src/devices/xditview/FontMap-X11: ...this.

	* LICENSES:
	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am (EXTRA_DIST): Reflect rename.

	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am (install_xditview

	(MapFont): Introduce new variable `file_name`, into which we
	assemble a destination file name from `destdir` (if not null)
	and the troff font name.  Handle memory allocation failure (by
	carefully dying).  Free allocated storage on success and failure
	paths out of the function.
	(usage): Document new `-d` option.

	[man,mdoc,me]: Revise hyphenation localization.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*reset-hyphenation-mode): New macro sets the
	hyphenation mode appropriate to the locale depending on the

	enablement); the latter is now interpreted as a Boolean.  Define
	new register `an*hyphenation-mode` reflecting these conditions.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac: Add new `mC` string to store the font name
	to be used for example regions.  In AT&T device-independent
	troff, "CW" was a common name, so use that.  It is however a
	terrible fit for groff's font family and style-combination
	functionality, and is inflexible in the face of font selection
	requests and escape sequences within the example region.  (One
	either needs to know the names of the fonts available on the
	output device, or suffer the indignity of mixed constant-width
	and proportional typefaces.)  Relatedly, drop groff-specific
	font remapping requests.
	(EX, EE): Ignore definition if GNU troff is the formatter.  Drop
	font family manipulation.  Drop specialized logic for groff's
	DVI output device.

	* tmac/an.tmac (initialization): Resurrect font remapping

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Slightly refactor.
	(pdfpic@cleanup, PDFPIC): Rename `pdfpic*file-name` to
	`pdfpic*file-name-base` since it is not used as a complete file
	name (but rather a basis for an ".eps" extension).
	(PDFPIC): When testing PDF file extension, include the "."; a
	file name like "mxyzptlkpdf" is too dubious to accept.  Also
	explicitly compare `systat` register as equal or not equal to
	zero, since its truth value is inverted from the expectations of
	*roff expressions.

2022-02-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac (PDFPIC): Refactor PDFPIC_NOSPACE handling.
	Stop shelling out to create, and then sourcing, a temporary file
	just to obtain the value of an environment variable.  groff
	already has the `\V` escape sequence for that purpose (it's even
	safe!).  Check that the value of $GROFF_PDFPIC_NOSPACE is a
	valid numeric expression before assigning it to a register.
	Trivially, use '=' instead of '==' as an equality operator.
	*roff languages do not use '=' as an assignment operator, and I
	believe the '==' synonym to be a sop to C programmers.

	[man]: Stop attempting to adjust pargraph tag lines.

	* tmac/an.tmac (TP): Disable adjustment inside the diversion.

2022-02-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (@z): Conceal bare tab after request name (exposed

	December.

2022-02-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grops,troff]: Migrate to term "scaling unit" in diagnostics.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp (ps_printer::do_import):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (warnscale_request):
	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (parse_term): Do it.

2022-02-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Add nroff mode fallback for `u` macro.

	* tmac/e.tmac (u): On nroff devices, bracket the first argument
	with \(ul (underline rule) special character escape sequences.
	{In plain language, '.u "like this"' renders "_like this_".}

	I regard this as a cosmetic and semantic improvement; since the
	quarter-em vertical motions used in troff mode were ignored in
	nroff mode, the effect was not underlining but a sort of
	strike-through, visible only at spaces in the argument.  The use
	of this macro was thus invisible in nroff output if no spaces
	were present in the argument.  This is probably the best we can
	do without a fatter interface to terminal device capabilities.

2022-02-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Simulate boxed text support on nroff devices with ISO 6429
	color escape sequences.

	* tmac/e.tmac (bx): Do it.  Add further fallback for non-groff
	formatters in nroff mode, bracketing the boxed argument with '|'
	glyphs.

	some from James Clark in 1992) attempting to illuminate the
	confusing history (and naming) of `$[rRvV]`.

	* doc/meref.me.in: Document it.  Introduce new terms
	"text vertical spacing" and "display vertical spacing" earlier
	and use them to condense and clarify discussions of their use.

	* NEWS: Add item.

2022-02-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Slightly refactor.

	* tmac/e.tmac (@h): Use groff default scaling operator in

	checking the line length works in compatibility mode.  Also move
	misplaced parenthesis in conditional expression.

2022-02-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[ms]: Refactor insufficient page length check.

	* tmac/s.tmac (pg@top): Drop extraneous closing parenthesis from
	numeric expression.  Change operator from '>' to '>='; a page
	length right at the boundary causes a spurious extra page break
	when a paragraphing macro is used to initialize the document.
	Condense diagnostic emission using the @error macro instead of
	duplicating it.  Change indentation to fit the style of the rest
	of the file (use hard tabs).  If aborting, truncate the page
	length to the current vertical position so that we don't
	uselessly output further vertical space.

	[man]: Trivially refactor an-ext.tmac.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac (EX, EE): Do a better job of keeping the
	name space promise made in comments at the top of the file.
	Rename `sP` register to `mP`.  Problem introduced by me in
	commit 69895ec20, 15 January 2020.  Also rename `la` and `ra`
	strings to `mL` and `mR`, respectively.  These (undocumented)
	string names date back to commit 259929625, 15 January 2007.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Files) <an-ext.tmac>: Document the
	aforementioned promise.

2022-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Refactor PDF bookmark support.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*bookmark): New internal macro calls
	`pdfbookmark` (only if the output device is 'pdf').
	(initialization): Migrate macro appendments to appropriate
	definitions.  Two cases...
	(SH, SS): ...were straightforward.
	(initialization): Another (for the man page title) was poorly
	placed when appended to the `TH` macro, skipping over the page
	header.  Move it instead...
	(PT): ...here.  But to keep this bookmark from being generated
	on every page of a document, we need a new variable
	`an*was-TH-bookmark-emitted` which is tested here and assigned
	once one bookmark corresponding to a `TH` call has been written.
	(TH): Initialize `an*was-TH-bookmark-emitted` to zero.
	(SS): Write the bookmark _before_ the subsection heading text.
	(initialization): Drop short-lived `BM` register.  It seems
	harmless to unconditionally include bookmarks in PDF output.  A
	PDF tool can strip them out if they're not desired, and viewers
	seem capable of minimizing or reducing the navigation pane (if
	they even offer one in the first place).

	* tmac/an.tmac (initialization): Rename new `BN` register to
	`BD`...
	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Options) <BD>: ...and document it.
	Also document `PT`'s new bookmarking responsibility.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?58949> and

	[grohtml,groff,nroff,troff]: Tweak usage message.

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp (usage):
	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (synopsis):
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (usage): Partly revert commit
	06ae7b0b8, 16 January.  Move an ellipsis back inside a bracketed
	operand (that is, an optional one).  On reflection, I think this
	notation makes it clearer that the command can be meaningfully
	run without operands.

2022-01-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/papersize.tmac: Slightly refactor.  Use new `stringdown`

2022-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Slightly refactor.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-prepare-page-title): Rename to...

	environment.

	(an-header): Update call site of `an*prepare-page-title`.

	(TH): Move planting of `an-header` trap from out of the midst of
	footer trap management.  Add comments.

	(an-header): Move `pl` and `sp` requests from here...
	(PT): ...to here.  While it's conceptually nice to have these
	macros consist solely of `tl` requests, it doesn't yield enough
	power to those who want to redefine them.  Add comment.

	(an-footer, BT): ...simile.

2022-01-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Implement PDF bookmark support for man pages.  Limitation: A
	{sub}section can only be bookmarked if it is specified in the
	arguments to the `SH` or `SS` requests, not on the next line in
	an input trap.  Thanks to Deri James for providing the
	fundamentals (blame me for any weird bits).

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-prepare-page-title): Define a new string,
	`an*page-ref-string`, which is the man page's own reference
	{such as "groff(1)"} without any abbreviation, ellipsis, or font
	selection or italic correction escape sequences.
	(SS): Define a new string, `an*subsection-heading`, storing the
	macro arguments (if any).  These could contain font selection
	escape sequences, for instance, a fact that becomes important
	later.
	(initialization):
	- Recognize `BM` register to enable PDF bookmarks (only on the
	  'pdf' output device); defaults on.  Recognize `BN` register to
	  set a base level/depth for the bookmarks; this is to ease
	  embedding of man pages in other PDF documents that already use
	  bookmarks.  The default is 0.  The registers are not yet
	  documented.
	- If the output device is 'pdf' and bookmarks are enabled, set
	  `PDFOUTLINE.FOLDLEVEL` and `PDFHREF.VIEW.LEADING` registers
	  {recognized by 'pdf.tmac'}.  Append to `TH`, `SH`, `SS` to get
	  the `an*page-ref-string`, `an-section-heading`, and
	  `an*subsection-heading` bookmarks in the document at the
	  applicable levels.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common: Add straw-man implementation--it doesn't
	support the `BM` and `BN` configuration parameters yet.  (This
	is enough to get bookmarks for the groff_mdoc(7) page to
	correctly appear in the new 'groff-man-pages.pdf' document.)
	(Dt, Sh, Ss): If the output device is 'pdf', place bookmarks in
	the document at levels 1, 2, and 3.

2022-01-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/trans.tmac: Further follow up commit c64fd60dff.  If the
	`andoc` wrapper is being used, perform man(7) localization (not
	just when `an` is loaded).

2022-01-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man pages]: Fix options used to generate compilations.

	* doc/doc.am (doc/groff-man-pages.pdf): Drop `-rU0` option (it's
	unnecessary since we don't yet have PDF hyperlink support in
	this document).  Add `-rC1` option to enable continuous page
	numbering.
	(doc/groff-man-pages.utf8.txt): Drop `-rC1 -rU1`.  Continuous
	page numbering is superfluous since page numbers are not shown
	in continuous rendering mode.  Stop turning on OSC 8 defaults;
	we don't know if the document will be viewed with a supporting
	pager+terminal combination, and further we don't yet have a
	mechanism for making `MR` man page cross references internal to
	the document when they indicate groff man pages.

2022-01-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man pages]: Ship compilations in UTF-8 text and PDF.

	Localization support and the resolution of Savannah #61266 have
	made it practical to batch-render all of groff's man pages as a
	single giant document.  Provide PDF and UTF-8 text (with ECMA-48
	escape sequences, but not the italic attribute or OSC 8
	sequences).

	Reasons for this addition include: {1} it is now possible,
	whereas I don't believe it was in any previous groff release;
	{2} many people still don't realize how much more pleasant
	reading typeset man pages can be (while a subjective assessment,
	I'm not alone[1]); {3} providing these forms permits full-text
	searching of groff's entire man page corpus via the PDF viewer
	or a pager like "less -R", the latter without sacrificing the
	style variations of the text that aid the reader to comprehend
	the material; {4} sentimentally, it honors the 50th anniversary
	of the first Unix manual (dated 3 November 1971)
	<https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/1stEdman.html>.

	* doc/doc.am (PROCESSEDDOCFILES): Add
	'doc/groff-man-pages.{pdf,utf8.txt}'.
	(GROFF_MAN_PAGES{1,2,3}): Add new macro storing names of all man
	pages generated in the build tree.  Motivate the reason for 3
	variables in a comment (it's due to groff locale switching).
	(GROFF_MAN_PAGES_ALL): Add convenience macro for use in
	dependency lists required by...
	('doc/groff-man-pages.{pdf,utf8.txt}'): ...these targets.
	Generate pages with the lint dial turned all the way up.

	[man]: Commit c64fd60dff was not quite cooked.  The localized
	strings (in English) for the manual section titles need to be
	set at every document load (i.e., when `TH` is called), but only
	if the groff locale is "english".  When switching locales, these
	strings were getting "stuck" in their non-English translations
	even when returning to an English page.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an*localize): New macro initializes strings.
	(TH): Call `an*localize` if the locale is "english".

	Now that the package does not abort upon the first whiff of any
	trouble, avoid littering groff's name spaces.  Take this
	opportunity to rename registers and strings to have obvious
	meaning to even the casual reader.

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac: Do it.
	(pdfpic@cleanup): New macro removes temporary strings and
	registers.
	(PDFPIC): Call the cleanup macro upon entry; this way, if we
	errored out from a previous call, we avoid confusion.  (We don't
	clean up upon an error return because the leftover objects might
	be useful for troubleshooting.)  Rename registers and strings,
	to get them under name space discipline and also to better
	suggest their purpose.
	- convert-pdf     -> pdfpic*do-conversion
	- pdf-offset-mode -> pdfpic*offset-mode
	- pspic-args      -> pdfpic*pspic-args

	Call cleanup macro before returning upon successful operation.

	[pdfpic]: Improve robustness.

	* tmac/pdfpic.tmac (@abort): Rename to `pdfpic@error`.  This is
	an auxiliary package, and something else could very well step on
	the former name (or worse, we break it if we're loaded later).
	(pdfpic@error): Stop aborting; simply report an error.  It's up
	to the user how serious `PDFPIC` macro problems are.  As noted
	in a comment, the user can easily `am pdfpic@error` to tack an
	`ab` request onto the end of its definition.  Always report
	input file name and line number.  Replace "[PDFPIC]" prefix with
	the name of the macro file complaining, to make it easier for
	groff non-experts to find.
	(PDFPIC): Return upon errors.  Recast diagnostic messages.  Stop
	implying that we perform any sort of probing test of file type
	{there's no telling what pdfinfo(1) will say}.  Apply new
	'stringdown' request so that we accept '.pdf' file name
	extension in any lettercase.  Test file argument for existence
	before proceeding (acknowledge TOCTTOU exposure).  Skip file if
	pipeline returned a non-zero exit status or the registers into
	which we extract the height and width are undefined (indicating
	failure of a temporary file to be created or read).  Reject
	files with non-positive image width or height reported by
	pdfinfo.  Validate `width` and `height` arguments, if given,
	rejecting non-positive values.

	- Replace "around line X" language in diagnostic messages with a
	  more idiomatic, and less embarrassing, simple report of an
	  integer.
	(table::init_output):
	- Add `entry_list->set_location()` call right before emitting
	  diagnostic about a table row not fitting on a page.
	- Turn off eqn(1) delimiters when emitting diagnostic about a
	  boxed table not fitting on a page (necessitating `.TS H`
	  support), using new NOP_NAME-based end macro to achieve this
	  inside a macro definition.
	(table::compute_expand_list): Suppress issue of too-wide table
	diagnostic when the `EXPAND` table flag is set (corresponding to
	the `expand` region option), because other code already emits
	diagnostics in this case.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60598>.  Problem appears
	to date back to commit 3bc4a53a45, 2013-01-07.

	[tbl]: Add unit test for format-time diagnostics.

	Ensure that the various format-time diagnostics that a
	tbl-preprocessed document can generate (1) occur when they are
	supposed to and (2) are appropriately suppressed by the
	"nowarn" and/or "nokeep" region options.  One of them is an
	error and cannot be suppressed by the former, but _can_ be by
	"nokeep", which is arguably a bug (Savannah #61878).

	* src/preproc/tbl/tests/format-time-diagnostics-work.sh: Do it.
	* src/preproc/tbl/tbl.am (tbl_TEST): Run test.

2022-01-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Trivially refactor.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::compute_expand_width):
	Declare and initialize variables closer to use.  Also, the width
	computed is compared to the line length and indentation, so use
	these well-established *roff terms in the diagnostic message.

2022-01-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Fix Savannah #61854.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (compute_expand_width): To properly
	warn if a table is too wide to fit between the indentation and
	the right margin, we need to compute its column widths including
	those eligible for expansion via the 'x' column modifier; we
	cannot use the same expression that we do to determine the
	amount of space we have to distribute among the expanded
	columns.  Iterate through columns again (the function was
	already doing so twice), once to potentially produce the
	warning, and then as before to distribute any available width.
	In other words, warnings were only being emitted for too-wide
	tables where one or more columns used the 'x' modifier.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61854>.

	[ms]: Don't add leaders that don't lead anywhere.

	* tmac/s.tmac (toc*end-entry): If no page number string
	`toc*num` is defined, don't interpolate its emptiness prefixed
	with a leader (and tab).  This makes "no" as the first argument
	to `XS` and `XA` work as documented, suppressing not only the
	page number but the leader after the entry.

	* tmac/tests/e_chapter-titles-work.sh: Fix missing shell test at
	end of script, which caused it to exit successfully regardless
	of any test failures.  Irritating.  This is among the fruits of
	the "never, ever use 'set -e'" tree.  (This religion has a thick

	[font]: For 'ascii' and 'latin1' devices, consistently define
	glyphs for ordinary characters before their special character

	internal assertion system messages shorter and more mutually

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (usage): Stop putting an ellipsis
	inside a bracket expression (for file arguments); that suggests
	misleading complexity.

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp (usage): Also don't set
	metasyntactic variable names in screaming capitals when they are
	separated from option letters by space and thus can't be
	confused with them.

2022-01-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libdriver]: Update diagnostic messages.

	* src/libs/libdriver/printer.cpp (printer::find_font): Describe
	the problem encountered instead of saying lamely "sorry, I can't
	continue".
	(printer::set_char_and_width, printer::set_numbered_char):
	Characterize input as "invalid", not "bad"; see commit bb7512b5,
	17 September.  When referring to font mounting position, say so.
	(printer::set_char_and_width): Describe required input character
	as "ordinary", not "ascii".  Apart from the incorrect casing,
	doing so better aligns with our terminology in groff_char(7),
	groff_out(5), our Texinfo manual, and other diagnostic messages;
	moreover, the use of "ascii" is potentially confusing to those
	whose environments use another encoding, like UTF-8 or IBM code
	page 1047.

	[font,tmac]: Simplify Unicode character mapping process.

	* tmac/unicode.tmac: Drop.  It was originally added in 2005 to
	suppress horizontal spacing of glyphs in the range U+0483..9.
	Its purpose has wandered over the years; most recently to map
	the Basic Latin ("ASCII") hyphen-minus, apostrophe, and grave
	accent to special characters (and thus ultimately to the General
	Punctuation block).  But this is unnecessary since the font
	descriptions for devices with the `unicode` property can provide
	this information, and anyone who wants to alter the mappings can
	change either font description files, output device macro files,
	or troffrc; or add `char` requests to their macro packages or
	documents (in decreasing magnitude of ambition).

	* tmac/html.tmac:
	* tmac/tty.tmac: Stop sourcing unicode.tmac.

	* tmac/tmac.am (TMACNORMALFILES): Stop shipping it.

	* font/devutf8/NOTES: Drop remarks about mapping of \[a~],
	\[a^], and Basic Latin circumflex accent and tilde.  Not only do
	I disagree with the reasoning (whether these glyphs are "too
	small" depends on the font used by the terminal emulator, over
	which we have no control), but this mapping happens in a
	completely different part of the source tree,
	src/libs/libgroff/glyphuni.cpp.

	* font/devhtml/R.proto:
	* font/devutf8/R.proto: Add mappings for the five Basic Latin
	characters that map surprisingly (see groff_char(7)) and are not
	syntactically significant to troff.  Three of these are ported
	from unicode.tmac.
	(html): Don't migrate the hyphen-minus--yet.

2022-01-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tty-char.tmac: Drop redundant logic.  We don't need to
	source the `cp1047` or `latin1` files here; `troffrc` will
	already have loaded `tty` for us, which loads whichever applies.

2022-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Separate concerns better; stop re-generating plain
	text and HTML documents when the 'doc' target is updated; these
	are already handled by the 'build_infodoc' target.
	(build_infodoc): Use existing phony targets for plain text and
	HTML output files instead of repeating filename literals.
	(doc_all): Remove those same two phony targets from this one's
	dependencies.

2022-01-14  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Rename `eoi_macro_name` to
	`end_of_input_macro_name`.  It's long, yes, but better parallels
	`blank_line_macro_name` and `leading_spaces_macro_name`.  It is
	not used in lengthy expressions and furthermore clarifies the
	meaning of the nearby function name `eoi_macro` in one use.

	[docs]: Be more careful with control characters when they are
	word-initial in filled text lines.  The idea is to prevent
	baffling surprises if a sentence is recast in a text editor, and
	a word beginning with a dot or neutral apostrophe is reflowed
	onto the beginning of the next input line--suddenly it is parsed
	as a control character.

	[tmac]: Manage hyphenation mode more carefully in localization
	packages.

	* tmac/{cs,de,it,sv}.tmac: Localize the man(7) package's HY
	register.

	* tmac/{cs,de,fr,it,sv}.tmac: When localizing the ms(7) package,
	use mode "2" instead of "3": the 'hy' request complains of
	contradictory hyphenation modes if "3" is used (the semantics of
	the hyphenation mode are complex and non-orthogonal; see
	groff(7) or our Texinfo manual).

	* tmac/{cs,de,en,fr,it,sv}.tmac: If the one language-independent
	hyphenation bit (don't hyphenate just prior to a page location
	trap) is set, preserve it; this way a system's troffrc or a
	macro package can set it and it will not get turned off by the
	localization package, which for best results should be loaded
	after any full-service package (and any auxiliary package
	requiring localized strings, though none are yet distributed
	with groff).

	Organize usage message consistently with our others, and stop
	wrapping the output lines: we know neither the width of the

2022-01-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libbib]: Refactor index header checking.

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp: Move more header validity checks...
	(index_search_item::load): ...from here...

	(index_search_item::check_header): ...to here.  Test all size
	values in header for negative values (never valid) before
	proceeding.  (These data could be changed to unsigned integer
	types in the file format, but that would require bumping the
	file version.  That in turn would make indexes generated with
	groff 1.23 unusable on systems running older groffs and, perhaps
	worse, would make groff 1.23 reject index files produced by
	older groffs.  On the other hand, the regeneration of index
	files should be, for those who use them, a common activity, and
	as long as the original database files are kept intact, it seems
	likely that most people, given modern machines, won't even
	notice a slowdown in document generation when refer(1) and
	friends fail to open the indices and fall back to full-text
	searches of the originals.  So we could still consider revising
	the file format before the groff 1.23 release.)

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp (index_search_item::load):
	Explicitly perform widening conversion from signed `off_t` value
	{from a stat(2) buffer} to an unsigned integer; quietens
	compiler warning about comparison between integers differing in
	signedness.

2022-01-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Expect stdbool.h, since we

2022-01-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libbib, libgroff, indxbib]: Slightly refactor.

	Also, it's silly to test even numbers > 2 for primality.  Stop.

	* src/include/lib.h: Include `stdbool.h` since this header file
	is used for both C and C++ code.

	* src/include/lib.h (is_prime):
	* src/libs/libgroff/prime.cpp (is_prime): Boolify.  Return
	Boolean instead of integer literals and demote return type to
	`bool`.  Include `assert.h` and add assertion to reject
	mathematically offensive input.

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp
	(index_search_item::read_common_words_file): Test only odd
	numbers for primality.
	* src/utils/indxbib/indxbib.cpp (main): Same.  Since the number
	comes from user input, make it (a potential hash table size) odd
	first.

	[man]: Internationalize and localize.

	* tmac/an.tmac (TH): Indirect predefined manual section titles
	through new strings `an*section[1-9]` so that they can be
	localized.
	(initialization): Give these strings English defaults.
	(TH): Move `ss` request from here...

	* tmac/en.tmac: ...to here.  It's not the man(7) package's
	business what the inter-word and inter-sentence spacing values
	are.  Also, having the correct[disputed] inter-sentence spacing
	value for English in its localization file restores it for the
	benefit of multi-lingual documents (mainly roff applications
	other than man(7)).

	* tmac/{cs,de,fr,it,sv}.tmac: Supply translations for the manual
	section titles; these were done by a monoglot American employing
	Google Translate, so those scandalized or running into howlingly
	wrong locutions are warmly invited to submit corrections.

	* tmac/trans.tmac: Load localized strings.

2022-01-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Handle auxiliary macro package
	arguments correctly.
	(process_arguments): Don't append the argument to the '-m'
	option to the command line; requested macro packages have
	dedicated logic.
	(construct_command): When iterating through requested package
	list, assume each element is an auxiliary package unless it
	matches an element in the list of main packages.  If the
	assumption holds, append the package name to a new list,
	`auxiliary_package_argument` (prefixed with '-m').  Push this
	list onto the command line after any main package.

	Also rename `$selected_main_package` to `$main_package` for
	brevity, and drop unused global lists `m` and
	`supplemental_package`.

	specification of auxiliary macro packages.

2022-01-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Drop unnecessary code.  Apart from being superfluous, it
	prevented a user-defined value of the `sx` register from being
	applied to the first footnote marker interpolated, a subtlety
	that escaped my notice because the first footnotes in our
	"meref" and "meintro" documents are not numeric, but symbolic,
	and their markers occurred on lines with vertical space above
	and below.  (The bug was further masked by an otherwise
	redundant redefinition of the `*` string inside the `)f` macro.)

	* tmac/e.tmac ()f, +c): Stop redefining footnote marker string
	`*` after updating the automatic footnote number; its
	interpolation is already backslash-protected.
	()d, pd): Stop redefining delayed text marker string `#` for an
	analogous reason.
	(initialization): Drop unneeded `_*` and `_#` strings.

	Thanks to Robert Goulding for his feedback and patience.  See
	<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61025>.

2022-01-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/e_footnote-marks-work.sh: Enhance test.  Confirm

2022-01-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Revise `n1` and `n2` interface and behavior.

	There were several bugs in the previous implementation.

	* tmac/e.tmac (po): Issue diagnostic if an attempt is made to
	set the page offset to a negative value.

	(n1): Accept new optional "C" argument to behave more (but not
	exactly) like roff(1), as the formerly-recognized "c" argument
	to `n2` did.  If present, the line length is reduced by the same
	amount (in new interface register `no`) as the line number field
	to preserve the overall line length.  Save the previous line
	length in internal register `_l` and set a flag, stored in `?N`,
	indicating this reduction.  Otherwise, the macro expects to be
	able to reduce the page offset to accommodate the line number.
	If it cannot (for example, with the zero page offset default
	used by nroff output devices), see above re: the `po` macro.

	(n2): Cache the last line number that may have been output,
	instead of the current one, so that we can operate on it
	consistently with user expectations.  Do this earlier, and
	rename this macro-local variable from `_ln` to `_n` so that we
	don't need groff's `do` request to operate on it.  Drop
	recognition of "c" as an optional second argument.  If turning
	off line numbering: if the line length was shortened (`?N`)
	restore the saved value and delete `_l` register; otherwise,
	reverse the change to the page offset.  Delete `_n` register.

	(initialization): Assign `\w'0000'u` to `no` register; this was
	previously hard-coded in `n1` and `n2`.  Initialize `?N` with 0.

	* doc/meref.me.in (roff Support): Update to reflect interface
	changes and describe behavior more accurately.

	* doc/meref.me.in (Summary):
	* tmac/groff_me.7.in (Registers): Document new `no` register and
	mark it as a groff extension.

	* NEWS: Add item documenting interface changes.

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/div.h:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Rename variables to reduce confusion
	between "end macros" and "end-of-input macros".  Call the latter
	"eoi" macros for brevity.

2021-12-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Fix code style nits.
	  - Use new terminology in diagnostic.  See commit 66ac1a8db9,
	    11 December.
	  - Drop unused '&&&' annotation for macro definitions.  This
	    was a BSD me(7) implementation detail wherein parts of the
	    package were broken out into module files, loaded if/when
	    their macros were called.  groff me(7) is monolithic, except
	    for devtag and refer(1) support.
	  - Remove '&&' end macro when we're done using it.

2021-12-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: (Re-)localize strings.

	* tmac/{cs,de,fr,it,sv}.tmac: Update package localizations to
	use new resources.  As a happy side effect (and with the new
	appendix string), the `+c` macro is now localized for Czech,
	German, and Swedish.

	* doc/meintro_fr.me.in (Les Parties du Document): Update example
	to reflect mixed-case default string used in chapter headings.

	* tmac/tests/e_ld-works.sh: Add tests for localization.

2021-12-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Internationalize strings.

	* tmac/e.tmac (initialization): Introduce internal
	`_mo1`..`_mo12`, `_dw1`..`_dw7`, and `_td_format` strings (with
	English defaults).  Define them outside of the new `ld` macro so
	that they can be overriden by localization packages.
	(ld) <dw, mo, td>: Populate via the above new strings.
	* tmac/trans.tmac: Stop defining `mo` and `dw`.  Instead, make
	them aliases of the new strings above.   Handle `wa` and `wc`
	similarly.

2021-12-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Add `ld` macro to re-init date/l10n stuff.

	* tmac/e.tmac (ld): New macro updates `y2` and `y4` registers
	and `wa`, `wc`, `mo`, `dw`, and `td` strings.

	* doc/meref.me.in (Miscellaneous, Predefined Strings):
	* tmac/groff_me.7.man (Macros): Document it.

	* tmac/tests/e_ld-works.sh: Add unit test.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61670>.

2021-12-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/e_chapter-titles-work.sh: Add unit test for chapter
	heading feature.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

2021-12-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Ease localization and customization by exposing
	strings for "Chapter" and "Appendix" instead of hard-coding
	these words into the `$c` macro.
	(initialization): Define new `wa` and `wc` strings.  Separate
	these and existing localization strings from `y2` and `y4`
	initialization since the latter don't involve natural languages.
	($c): Interpolate these strings in chapter and appendix headings
	and in calls to `$C` hook macro.  Set "Chapter" and "Appendix"
	in mixed case instead of full capitals, and set one
	adjustable nonbreaking word space `\~` between them and the
	chapter number instead of two unadjustable nonbreaking spaces.
	{These changes do slightly alter the default output of the
	package when the `+c` macro is used.}

	* doc/meref.me.in (Predefined Strings):
	* tmac/groff_me.7.man (Strings): Document new strings.

	* doc/meintro.me.in (Parts of the Basic Paper): Update example
	to reflect mixed-case default string.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61661>.

2021-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (@p): Deactivate right alignment (the effect of
	groff's `rj` request) when starting a new paragraph.
	* doc/meref.me.in (Paragraphing) <lp>: Document this.

2021-12-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac ()c): Add bounds check to avoid attempting to set
	a negative indentation, provoking a troff warning.  Problem
	exposed by formatting "meintro_fr.me" document with default
	nroff mode line length.

2021-12-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor (boolify).

	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/div.h:
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Rename variables and demote from
	  `int` to `bool`.  Initialize and assign them using Boolean
	  literals.  The new names try harder to express a logical
	  predicate, and start with verbs to resist interpretation as
	  noun phrases.
	  - exit_started -> is_exit_underway
	  - done_end_macro -> is_end_macro_finished
	  - seen_last_page_ejector (demoted but not renamed)
	  - began_page_in_end_macro (demoted but not renamed)

2021-12-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Explain presence of undocumented `$r` and `$R`
	registers.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61683>.

2021-12-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (bc): To get to the next column, space by the page
	length `.p`, not by the distance to the next trap (or 24 inches,
	as hard-coded in me(7) traditionally).  It is up to any sprung
	traps to issue further space requests or otherwise ensure a
	transition to the next column.

	See <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55081> for discussion.

2021-12-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac ({): Fix missing scaling unit in arithmetic
	expression: broke footnotes in troff mode.  Problem introduced
	by me in commit 6eafd208, 16 December.  Thanks to Robert
	Goulding for the (informal) report.

2021-12-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (doc/{pic,webpage}.html): Quieten build.  Stop
	passing `-p` (progress) option to postprocessor, which produces
	TeX-like bracketed page numbers when images occur.

2021-12-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (.ms.html): Drop unused suffix rule.

2021-12-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_XFAIL_TESTS): Mark test
	"e_footnotes-work-with-columns.sh" as expected to fail (as it
	does now, consequent to a reverted commit).

2021-12-16  Dave Kemper <saint.snit@gmail.com>

	* man/groff_tmac.5.man: Fix minor errors.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61633>.

2021-12-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Parameterize line height adjustment when super/subscripting.

	* tmac/e.tmac (initialization): Assign 0.2m to register `$x`.2m.
	({, <}: Apply adjustment, multiplied by -1 for superscripts.

	* doc/meref.me.in:
	* tmac/groff_me.7.man: Document it.

	* NEWS: Add item.

	* doc/meintro.me.in:
	* doc/meintro_fr.me.in:

2021-12-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac ($c): Draw the footnote separator no wider than
	the column width.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61675>.

2021-12-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (2c): Accept an empty first argument, permitting
	the number of columns to be specified but preserving the default
	column separation.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61671>.

2021-12-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (initialization): Initialize `$C` hook, preventing
	`mac` warnings from troff(1) if chapter title feature is used.

2021-12-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (i, bi): Add italic corrections.

2021-12-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Fix groff warnings and correctness issue.
	(n2): Prefix `ie` request with `do` because it uses the groff
	`\B` escape sequence.  Use braces to group multiple requests
	after an `el` request: `ie` and `el` count as two requests, not
	one.  Add comment regarding the unfortunate choice of brace
	style given *roff's syntactical constraints.
	(n2, (c): Conceal bare tab in request argument list (exposed by
	no longer stripping the macro file).

2021-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Revise diagnostic messages to follow GNU Coding Standards,
	identifying what is emitting them.

	* tmac/e.tmac (_e): New string holds "e.tmac".
	(@err): New macro constructs and issues diagnostics.  Add file
	name to messages when available.  Suppress line number when
	unavailable.
	(check_page_length, @z, @h, n2, sk, @p, @(, @), (c, )c, EQ, (f,
	++, @U): Call `@err` instead of invoking `tm` request.  Revise
	wording of messages in an attempt at clarity.

	Continues the long process of fixing Savannah #52463.

2021-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Slightly refactor footnote numbering.
	()f): Tighten code style and end string definition with comment.
	(+c, initialization): Drop unused auto-incrementation of
	footnote number register `$f`.  Add new string `_*` to use when
	{re-}initializing `*` outside of a footnote diversion, and
	interpolate the footnote number register instead of a literal.

2021-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tests/e_footnote-marks-work.sh: Add unit test.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

2021-12-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Fix automatic numbering of delayed text.
	(initialization): Add `_#` string for use in multiple
	assignments of `#` string.
	(initialization, pd): Remove unused auto-incrementation from
	`$d` delayed text number register.
	()d): Increment `$d` register unconditionally, no longer
	conditionally on whether the delayed text marker string `#` has
	been interpolated.
	()d, pd): Update `#` string using new `_#` string.  Stop
	initializing the string with `\k` mark-setting escape sequence.

	* doc/meref.me (Annotations) <)d>: Document now-unconditional
	incrementation of `$d` register.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61632>.

	Kemper for the report.

2021-12-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Generate me(7) manual sources as part of the build.  We had been
	shipping 'me' sources with the string '@VERSION@' in them and
	only sed-replacing that to produce generated PostScript, but
	this replacement was not occurring for users who processed the
	documents themselves.

	* doc/meintro.me:
	* doc/meintro_fr.me:
	* doc/meref.me: Rename these to...
	* doc/meintro.me.in:
	* doc/meintro_fr.me.in:

	(dist_otherdoc_DATA, EXTRA_DIST): Add `$(GENERATEDDOCFILES)`.
	(doc/me{intro{,_fr},ref}.me): Add new target rules.

	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Update test to look for
	the above source tree documents under their new names.

2021-12-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2021-12-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (DOC_SED): Add substitution of command prefix
	{"@g@"} so we can make accurate reference to groff commands with
	Unix counterparts in our documentation.

2021-12-05  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac: Add nroff mode string definitions for 4.4BSD
	compatibility.
	  - Define '{' and '}' (superscripting) strings as '[' and ']'.
	  - Define '<' and '>' (subscripting) strings as '\(la and
	    '\(ra' if available on the device, otherwise '<' and '>'.

	* tmac/tests/e_footnote-marks-work.sh: Update expected output.

	[troff]: Remove `DEBUGGING` preprocessor cruft.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp:
	* src/roff/troff/mtsm.cpp: Stop defining `DEBUGGING`
	preprocessor macro (as empty).

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Give `DEBUG_OPTION` an empty string
	value if the former is undefined, so the `getopt_long()` call
	will compile.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61436>.  Thanks to Bjarni

2021-11-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Slightly refactor table format column modifier `p` and
	`v` validation.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_format): Make code terser by
	introducing references to `list->point_size` and
	`list->vertical_spacing`.  Doing this requires a new scope
	{because a switch case isn't one} so add it, without updating
	indentation for this commit.  When complaining of out-of-range
	type size or vertical spacing, report the limit.

2021-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Improve diagnostic messages.

	Revise diagnostic messages generally to use terminology
	consistent with the recent rewrite of tbl(1), identify a
	contextual token when possible, and communicate more helpfully.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_options): Tell the user
	which region option is missing a closing parenthesis or cannot
	accept an empty argument.  Refer to region options as such, not
	simply "options" (so they can't be confused with command-line
	options).  Say that input is "invalid" instead of "bad".
	(process_format): Say "table format specification" instead of
	just "format".  Say "column classifier" instead of "format".
	When a column modifier is missing an argument or a closing
	parenthesis, identify it and refer to it as a "column modifier"
	instead of omitting context.  Inform user that arguments to `p`
	and `v` column modifiers must be "(optionally signed) integer"s,
	not "numbers", lower these diagnostics' levels from error to
	warning, and indicate that the modifier is ignored.  Clarify
	diagnostic when extra characters trail `.` at the end of a table
	format line.
	(process_data): Say "table entry" instead of "data entry" when
	discarding an excess one.
	(process_table): Say we're giving up on "this table region", not
	this "table", particularly since any table continuations (.T&)
	are ignored.

2021-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Fix call to `getopt_long()`.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (main): Stop telling `getopt_long()`

2021-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Tweak usage message.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (usage): Document `--version`.  Give
	version retrieval mode separate synopsis.  Use more normative
	synopsis syntax.

2021-11-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: Fix code style nits.

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (process_input_file,
	entry_format::debug_print, process_data, main): Replace
	`assert(0)` calls with communicative predicates.
	(struct input_entry_format, input_entry_foramt::debug_print,
	process_format): Boolify.  Demote and rename `int`s
	`last_column` and `equal` to `bool`s named `is_last_column` and
	`is_equal_width`.  Assign them Boolean literals.
	(process_format): Boolify.  Demote `have_expand`, `got_format`,
	and `got_period` from `int` to `bool`.  Use Boolean literals in
	assignments thereto.
	(process_options): Swap order of null pointer comparison when a
	typo or thinko could lead to lvalue assignment.
	(process_data): Boolify.  Demote `give_up` from `int` to `bool`.
	Demote and rename `int` `row_comment` to `bool`
	`seen_row_comment`.  Use Boolean literals in assignments
	thereto.
	(main): Use standard C library symbols `EXIT_SUCCESS` and
	`EXIT_FAILURE` with `exit()` calls instead of `0` and `1`.

2021-11-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Fix Savannah #61520.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Move hash `preprocessor_for_macro` to
	global scope since it is now mutable across `do_line` subroutine
	calls.
	(do_line): Adjust regex matching an end macro to work better.
	Check names of macros being defined by the document; if they
	start with '[' or ']', stop attempting to detect refer(1) usage,
	by deleting its key from the `preprocessor_for_macro` hash.

	* doc/groff.texi (Page Motions):
	* man/groff.7.man (Escape short reference): Fix error: the `\r`,

	being vertical motions.  Add discussion and example.  Thanks to
	Bjarni Ingi Gislason for pointing out the problem in groff(7)
	and Tadziu Hoffman for his lucid explanation.

2021-11-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/include/error.h: Drop `extern` storage class from

	most of groff.

2021-11-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Update diagnostic

2021-11-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Update diagnostic
	messages to use more normative language: say "type size" instead
	of "point-size", and "escape sequence" instead of "escape".
	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	use_point_size_escape_with_single_digit_arg.sh: Update expected
	diagnostic wording in text.

2021-11-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Boolify.  Update
	prototype.  Demote return type from `int` to `bool`.  Use
	Boolean literals for return values.  Similarly demote local
	variable, rename it from `bad_digit` to
	`contains_invalid_digit`, and use Boolean literals with it.

2021-11-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tbl]: If "nowarn", suppress table row warning.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::init_output): Bracket the
	generated groff code that emits a warning if a table row
	overruns a page location trap (usually, is too long to
	vertically fit on the page) in a test for whether the "nowarn"
	region option was given, so that this warning is suppressed as
	well when that option is used.
	* src/preproc/tbl/tbl.1.man (Region options): Document new
	"nowarn" behavior.

	{"nokeep" also suppresses this warning, for a different reason;
	no diversion is created to hold the table row, so its vertical
	size does not exist to be compared to the distance to the next
	page trap.}

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61477>.

2021-11-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::do_vspan): Fix code style
	nits.  Swap order of null pointer and zero equality comparisons
	when a typo or thinko could lead to lvalue assignment.  Break a
	series of 6 and-ed assertion predicates into separate `assert()`
	calls--sure to be less maddening for anyone who has to debug
	such a contingency.  Clarify comment since C++98 didn't yet have
	`nullptr`.

2021-11-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[m4]: Clean up shell variable quoting and bracing.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_PROG_YACC, GROFF_MAKEINFO,
	GROFF_BROKEN_SPOOLER_FLAGS, GROFF_TARGET_PATH_SEPARATOR): Stop
	bracing shell variable expansions that don't require it; the
	shell is not make(1).
	(GROFF_PROG_YACC, GROFF_MAKEINFO): Double-quote shell variable
	expansions that might produce whitespace.
	(GROFF_MAKEINFO): Drop unnecessary leading zeroes from version
	number component construction.  Drop unnecessary escaping of
	plus sign in expr(1) input.

2021-11-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[m4]: Clean up test(1) usage.

	Get rid of string (non-)nullity tests and comparisons involving
	concatenation with garbage (usually "x").  Even the GNU Autoconf
	manual's shell portability material doesn't recommend this.  It
	must be either a bodge cooked up by shell programmers who
	couldn't remember to quote variable expansions, or a workaround
	for shells of such poor quality that they defied the odds and
	decayed out of usage or got fixed.

	Instead, use double quotes (only where necessary).  Test for
	non-empty strings with "test -n" and empty strings with "test
	-z".  Stop quoting literal comparands that obviously have no
	shell metacharacters in them.

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TEXI2DVI): Add dependency on
	`GROFF_MAKEINFO` macro.  Rewrite to also test `MAKEINFO`
	variable, which is empty if the `makeinfo` command is not
	installed or too old.  Consequently ignore `texi2dvi` if is too
	old without having to do a version check (since it and
	`makeinfo` are distributed together, both being part of GNU
	Texinfo).

	* doc/doc.am (.texi.dvi, .texi.pdf): Update error message to
	indicate that `texi2dvi` is _either_ missing or too old.

2021-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_MAKEINFO): Stop throwing a warning if the
	installed `makeinfo` is old but the distributed Info manual is
	up to date.  This is not a configure-time problem; the user will
	be notified when they run 'make' if they modify doc/groff.texi,
	or if they run 'make doc' (which has required a TeX installation
	for years).  Empty the `MAKEINFO` variable immediately if a
	too-old version is detected.  Drop needless `AC_SUBST`itution of
	the detected `makeinfo` version.

2021-11-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_HTML_PROGRAMS): Clarify message; it is only
	groff-generated HTML that is disabled by the absence of the

	Texinfo manual in HTML format.)

2021-11-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[build]: Drop `BUILD_INFODOC` symbol.  Ship manual in GNU Info,
	text, and HTML forms in distribution archive.

	* Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Initialize.
	(MOSTLYCLEANADD): Drop unused variable.
	* configure.ac: Drop `AM_CONDITIONAL([BUILD_INFODOC]...`.
	* doc/doc.am (EXTRA_DIST): Rearrange shipment of our Texinfo
	manual source files to precede all of the generated forms, for
	clarity.  Drop all `BUILD_INFODOC` conditionals.  Make
	`build_infodoc` phony target depend on plain text, GNU Info, and
	HTML forms of Texinfo manual unconditionally.  Also drop unused
	variables `groffinfodir`, `groffpdfdir`, and `texi2dvi_missing`.
	(EXTRA_DIST, MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add Info form of manual.
	Drop glob pattern attempting to match the segments that
	`makeinfo` breaks it into.  It isn't necessary for
	MAINTAINERCLEANFILES.
	(EXTRA_DIST, MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add text form of manual.
	(EXTRA_DIST, MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add HTML form of manual.
	(dist-hook): Depend on new (phony) target `dist-info-bits`.
	(dist-info-bits): Look for the info document in the build
	directory, then the source directory.  (It could be in either
	place depending on whether the build from a Git working tree is
	being done in or out of a separate build directory.)  When
	found, copy the segments to the assembly area for the
	distribution archive.
	(install_infodoc): Refactor.  Remove any groff info files from
	the destination info directory using a shell glob directly
	instead of a partly redundant ls(1) command substitution.
	Similarly, use a shell glob to cp(1) the info files (including
	any matched segments) to the destination info directory before
	running `install-info`.  (In this process I learned that
	`install-info` doesn't "install" anything; instead, it
	{de-}registers info files with their top-level catalog.)

2021-11-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (.texi.txt, .texi.html): Reorder pattern rules to
	make it clearer which formats require only `makeinfo` and which
	require `texi2dvi`.  The latter imposes more build dependencies,
	including a full TeX installation.

2021-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff,grops]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/devices/grops/ps.cpp: Explicitly preprocessor-include
	"lib.h" since we use the `PI` symbol it defines.

	* src/include/lib.h: Add inclusion guard.  Wrap only `extern "C"
	and its braces in preprocessor conditionals, so that prototypes
	are present in the header even for C language code that
	#includes this header.  Add `static` storage class to `PI`
	symbol to avoid redefinition errors from the linker.

	* src/libs/libgroff/iftoa.c (if_to_a):
	* src/libs/libgroff/itoa.c (i_to_a, ui_to_a): Add `const` type
	qualifier to function definitions for agreement with prototypes
	in "lib.h".  Drop local copies of prototypes.

	[libgroff]: Centralize definitions of {U,}INT_DIGITS.

	* src/libs/libgroff/iftoa.c:
	* src/libs/libgroff/itoa.c: Move definitions of `INT_DIGITS` and
	`UINT_DIGITS` from here...
	* src/include/lib.h: ...to here.

	* src/libs/libgroff/iftoa.c:
	* src/libs/libgroff/itoa.c: Preprocessor-include "lib.h".  This

	* src/include/lib.h: Add them where necessary.

2021-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (OP): Fix code style nits.  Don't quote macro
	arguments unnecessarily.  Use consistent backslashing.  Use
	groff font escape sequence syntax.  Use adjustable non-breaking
	space escape sequence instead of a non-adjustable one.
	Parenthesize numeric expression for better readability.

	[libgroff]: Make allocator replacement optional.  Switch it
	off by default, relying on C++ runtime new/delete support.

	* configure.ac: Call new `GROFF_USE_GROFF_ALLOCATOR` m4 macro.
	Use `AM_CONDITIONAL` to set Automake variable
	`USE_GROFF_ALLOCATOR` if appropriate.  Report whether the
	allocator is used in configure script output summary.
	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_USE_GROFF_ALLOCATOR): Define new macro to
	collect user preference.  The default is off.
	* src/libs/libgroff/libgroff.am (libgroff_a_SOURCES): Build and
	link new.cpp only if we are to `USE_GROFF_ALLOCATOR`.

	* NEWS: Add item.

2021-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Report a human-readable message if
	no system tmac prefix is found, instead of leaving the ellipsis
	hanging.

2021-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_TMAC): Use separate shell variable for
	`AC_MSG_RESULT()` content since the human-readable string we
	populate it with in the empty case is not appropriate for later
	`AC_SUBST()`-itution.  Problem introduced by me in commit
	19670348, 31 October.

2021-11-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tmac.am (MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Remove `$(TMACMDOCFILES)`.
	This variable, formerly named `TMACMDOCSTRIPFILES`, should not
	be used in a clean target because its contents are (no longer)
	generated files.  Problem introduced by me in commit 24602f42, 4
	July (only noticeable in within-source-tree builds).

2021-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff,pic]: Check `strdup()` return value.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (struct text_file): Add `fatal()`
	member function.
	(text_file::fatal): Implement it.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load_desc):
	* src/preproc/pic/troff.cpp (troff_output::set_location): Die if
	`strdup()` returned a null pointer.

2021-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/error.cpp (do_error_with_file_and_line):
	Revise to eliminate `fprintf()` calls, which might perform
	dynamic memory allocation, rendering this function unsafe to
	call after memory allocation failures.  Since this function is
	near the top of our diagnostic output call stack, that would be
	unfortunate.  `errprint()` does not use dynamic allocation, nor
	do the `i_to_a()` and `ui_to_a()` functions it calls to format
	integers.

2021-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Add `strdup` to AC_CHECK_FUNCS since we are
	using it and the whole point of libgroff's `strsave()` was to
	get along without it.  But `strdup` has been standardized in
	POSIX for 20 years (SUSv3, POSIX:2001) and is on its way into
	ISO standard C (N2353) and C++ (P2391R0) as well.

2021-11-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/strsave.cpp (strsave): Call `strcpy()` only
	if `malloc()` did not return a null pointer.  Problem noted by
	Ingo Schwarze.

2021-11-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/fontfile.cpp (font::open_file): Don't open
	user-specified font file names with slashes in them; i.e., don't
	traverse directories outside the configured font path.  Also
	refuse to open the file if the `sprintf()` used to construct its
	file name doesn't write the expected quantity of bytes to the
	destination buffer.

	Schwarze for feedback.

	[libgroff]: Fix diagnostic error wording.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Fix diagnostic

	tag}, then typeset the URI as part of the indented paragraph.

	if there were any.

	opened.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::add_entry): If we see a '\^'
	entry on the first row of a table, it's invalid, but we need to
	create an empty entry in its place.  Otherwise, someone can put
	another '\^' right below the one on the first row, creating a
	reference to a nonexistent table entry and provoking a SEGV.
	Issue an error diagnostic (distinct from the one in
	`do_vspan()`), create the entry, and skip `do_vspan()` (given a
	'^' in a first-row definition, it issues an error diagnostic and
	returns early, which suffices).  Problem appears to date back to
	groff 1.02 (June 1991) at the latest.

	[man]: Tweak computation in URI breaking.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac (UE, ME): Stop adding the page offset `.o`
	when performing the available horizontal space computation for
	the typeset URI string.  This made no difference on nroff
	devices (grotty; even with `.po 15n`), but it caused the
	breaking decision to be too conservative on troff devices
	{grops}, forcing some URIs that would fit on the current line to
	the next one.

	* tmac/tests/an-ext_UE-breaks-before-long-URIs.sh: Add test of
	URI with no link text, which also has break points after every
	character, so that we detect even slight alterations.

	[libgroff]: Do more device and font description file validation,
	resolve an assertion failure arising from a negative declared
	device resolution, and correct a documentation error.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Include more
	information about invalid input in diagnostic messages.
	  - When a kern pair's amount is missing or invalid, report the
	    name of the kern pair.
	  - When someone tries to declare the first entry in the charset
	    section as an alias, report the glyph name.
	  - Identify the token for the unnamed character if an attempt
	    is made to alias it.
	  - When an out-of-range character type is applied to a glyph,
	    name the glyph.
	(font::load_desc): Same.
	  - Drop redundant zero initialization of `res`.
	  - Check all directives that take basic units for positive
	    values, adding `res`, `unitwidth`, `paperwidth`, and
	    `paperlength`.  Update this diagnostic to demand positive,
	    not nonnegative, values.
	  - When the font count is long in a `fonts` directive, report
	    how many font names were declared (and thus expected).  (If
	    the count is short, the next line is read for a font name,
	    like 'tcommand' in our devutf8/DESC.)
	  - When interpreting a `papersize` directive, throw an error
	    and return false if `res` has not yet been encountered,
	    since it is used in subsequent computations.
	  - When a paper format cannot be determined, report the
	    original declared value from the DESC file.  Use `strdup()`
	    to save it since it gets clobbered by the resolving process.
	    `free()` the saved string when we're done, regardless of
	    error condition.

	* doc/groff.texi (Device and Font Files):
	* man/groff_font.5.man (DESC file format): Document additional
	exception to order-indifference of directives: (at least one)
	`res` must precede `papersize`.

2021-10-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff (doc-setup-page-layout): Set the title

	`sub->glyphs`; the latter is a member array of a `subencoding`
	struct so it can't be a null pointer.  (`glyphs` is an array of

	[troff]: Handle special character escape sequences that map to
	basic Latin glyphs in device control escape sequences
	consistently among output devices.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char): Rearrange
	conditionals.  This is the logic that puts the "whatever" within
	a \X'whatever' escape sequence into GNU troff's intermediate
	output.  Handle adjustable and nonadjustable space escape
	sequences ("\~" and \ ") first.  Then, if the token is a special
	character escape sequence, retrieve its "contents" (glyph name).
	Move the basic Latin mapping for the seven glyph names '-',
	'aq', 'dq', 'ga', 'ha', 'rs', and 'ti' here, before checking
	whether the device description issued the
	'use_charnames_in_special' directive.  This way, the 'html' and
	'xhtml' output devices can straightforwardly embed these basic
	Latin characters in device control escapes (notably, "html:",
	for which the present convention is to follow the this tag
	immediately with a literal HTML URI, complete with `<a href>`
	element syntax).  If the special character is none of these and
	we should 'use_charnames_in_special', proceed as groff 1.22.4
	and earlier did.  This is a behavior change, as was my addition
	of this translation mechanism in the first place, so...

	just prior to the end of this macro definition, in preparation
	for next page to be rendered.

	* tmac/tests/an_handle-degenerate-input-quietly.sh: Test it.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/61402>, a regression from
	groff 1.22.4 (problem introduced by me in the course of many
	changes to trap management and header/footer handling to work
	nicely in batch rendering with -mandoc and mdoc(7) documents).

	[man]: Warn if `TE` table macro called but `TW` register (set by
	tbl(1)) undefined.  Arrange it so that we warn only once per
	man(7) document, not per table region.

	* tmac/an.tmac (TH): Remove `TW` register when processing new
	document and clear `an-was-tbl-failure-reported` register.
	(TE): Check `TW` and `an-was-tbl-failure-reported` registers; if
	the former is undefined and the latter false, emit the message
	and set `an-was-tbl-failure-reported`.

	Addresses part of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61379>.
	Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason for the suggestion.

	[tests]: Improve portability.

	* src/devices/grotty/tests/osc8_works.sh: Fix typo in test.
	Multiple regex quantifiers after an atom were not flagged with a
	diagnostic by GNU grep 3.3, but were by BSD grep 2.5.1-FreeBSD.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/smoke-test_html_device.sh: Stop trying to
	set $LC_CTYPE to "C.UTF-8"; some systems don't support this
	expediency.  Skip the test if the tester hasn't configured the
	environment adequately.

	* tmac/tests/s_TC-works-with-percent-in-custom-titles.sh: Fix
	portability problems exposed by FreeBSD sed (which version is
	unclear).  {1} Use POSIX BREs, dropping use of '+' quantifier.
	{2} Add semicolons to terminate commands before braces on the
	same line.  Simplify surrounding test structure.
	* tmac/tests/e_footnotes-work-with-columns.sh: Fix same two sed
	problems.
	* tmac/tests/andoc_flush-between-packages.sh:
	* tmac/tests/doc_accept-mixed-case-section-headings.sh:
	* tmac/tests/an_TS-do-not-keep-tables-when-cR-set.sh: Fix same
	sed semicolon problem.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/on_latin1_device_oq_is_0x27.sh: Rewrite
	test to stop using a here document (containing an unpaired
	single quote) inside a command substitution, which is broken in
	GNU Bash 3.2 and some other versions.  Instead construct the
	input with printf(1).  Also gets rid of a Bashism (process
	substitution) that Ingo pointed out years ago.
	* src/utils/grog/tests/recognize-perl-pod.sh: Same problem,
	different solution.  The Perl POD output is far too large to
	construct programmatically, so move it into an external file...
	* src/utils/grog/tests/foo.man: ...here.
	* src/utils/grog/grog.am (EXTRA_DIST): Ship new test artifact.

2021-10-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Make sed-based insertion of `lf` requests more
	portable: a dance is required to embed a literal newline inside
	a sed expression inside a shell command executed as part of a
	Make target rule.  We assume that neither the POSIX shell $''
	operator nor a working printf(1) is available.
	(DOC_GROFF): Define a shell variable containing a literal
	newline, evading make(1) and echo(1)'s valiant attempts to
	consume it.
	(doc/pic.html, doc/webpage.html): Repeat trick, slightly
	modified since the dependency needs to be manually identified.

	Solution adapted from the GNU Autoconf manual, "Newlines in Make
	Rules".

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61265>.  Thanks to John
	Gardner for the report.

	* tmac/an.tmac (TH): Stop populating `an-extra3` (the default
	center header) if the section argument is "3p".  "3p" does not
	always mean a Perl-related man page; Debian- and Arch
	Linux-based systems[1][2] (at least) have long used a "3perl"
	suffix, while OpenBSD appears to still use "3p" for Perl[3],
	which is also used by the POSIX man page distribution[4].
	Fortunately, Perl and POSIX are reliable at providing a fifth
	argument to `TH` anyway, so our fallback is as unnecessary as it
	is non-impartial.
	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Document structure macros) <TH>:
	De-document the above behavior.

2021-10-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* man/groff_char.7.man (Description, Special character escape
	forms): Document the `\C` escape sequence.  Fix error: \[a] is
	_not_ "translated to \a, the uninterpreted leader escape
	sequence," but requests a glyph _named_ '\a' internally--it
	appears thus in diagnostic messages and, importantly, in the
	font description files defining special character glyph names.

2021-10-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac: Refactor to reduce repetition.
	(an-break-paragraph): New macro handles paragraph-breaking tasks

	constituent requests.

2021-10-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (TP): Reset type size, vertical spacing, and font

	sequence does _not_ support an auto-incrementation amount.
	* man/groff_out.5.man (Command reference/Simple commands): Fix
	erroneous claim: 'N' is not a GNU roff extension; it appears on

	[groff]: Fix code style nits.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main, help): Use standard C library
	preprocessor symbols `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` instead
	of 0 and 1 literals, respectively.  See commit fa4c27e9, 7
	September.
	(main): Replace `assert(0)` with a communicative predicate.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tmac.am: Build more quietly.
	(tmac/stamp-wrap): Prefix all rule commands with `$(AM_V_at)`;
	since this target is a stamp file instead of a useful artifact
	to be distributed, make its creation completely silent by
	default.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/troff.am: Build more robustly.
	(src/roff/troff/majorminor.cpp): Drop progress-reporting `echo`
	in favor of prefixing final rule command with `$(AM_V_GEN)`.
	Prefix earlier rule commands with `$(AM_V_at)`.  Use `printf`
	instead of `echo` to build the file, and create a temporary file
	at first so that we don't race with the compiler on parallelized
	builds.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/eqn/eqn.am (neqn): Simplify: drop removal of
	target prior to overwriting it; any system we can build groff on
	should have a shell that implements the clobbering semantics of
	the POSIX shell '>' operator.  (If this isn't true, we have
	_many_ other target rules in our build to which we must add
	prefatory `$(RM)`s, or I miss my guess.)

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/libgroff.am: Build more quietly and
	robustly.
	(src/libs/libgroff/version.cpp): Drop progress-reporting `echo`
	in favor of prefixing final rule command with `$(AM_V_GEN)`.
	Prefix earlier rule commands with `$(AM_V_at)`.  Use `printf`
	instead of `echo` to build the file, and create a temporary file
	at first so that we don't race with the compiler on parallelized
	builds.  Drop nilpotent sed transformation; this looks like a
	relic of past times when we'd drop a trailing ".0" from the
	version number stored in the C symbol `Version_string`.
	(charset.alias, ref-del.sed, ref-add.sed): Prefix rule command
	with `$(AM_V_GEN)`.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/devices/xditview/xditview.am: Build more quietly.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devpdf/devpdf.am: Build more quietly.
	(font/devpdf/enc/text.enc, font/devpdf/map/symbolmap,
	$(DEVPDFFONTMAP_1)): Prefix all rule commands with
	`$(AM_V_at)`; since these are all `mkdir`s and `cp`s, I reason
	that little can go wrong with them that won't be disclosed by
	these tools' own diagnostic messages, so they are insignificant
	from a perspective of build progress.

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Build more quietly.
	(doc/examples.stamp): Prefix all rule commands with
	`$(AM_V_at)`; since this target is a stamp file instead of
	a useful artifact to be distributed, make its creation
	completely silent by default.
	(doc/groff.info, .texi.txt): Prefix directory creation with
	`$(AM_V_at)` and `makeinfo` command with `$(AM_V_GEN)`.
	(.texi.dvi, .texi.pdf): Prefix directory creation with
	`$(AM_V_at)` and `makeinfo` command with `$(AM_V_GEN)`.  Send
	diagnostic message to standard error if `texi2dvi` is
	unavailable.
	(.texi.html): Prefix directory creation with
	`$(AM_V_at)`.  Two HTML versions are produced, in split and
	unsplit versions; prefix one `makeinfo` command with
	`$(AM_V_GEN)` and the other with `$(AM_V_at)` so that only one
	message is produced.
	(gnu.eps): Drop useless/noisy `echo` command.  Prefix copy
	operation with `$(AM_V_at)`.  Send diagnostic messages to
	standard error if there are problems with the Netpbm tools.

	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES): The `mostlyclean` target was leaving a file,
	`groff.info-3`, behind in the build tree.  At some point our
	Texinfo manual grew beyond earlier expectations.  Use a glob
	`[0-9]` instead (giving a hostage to fortune that `makeinfo`
	will never split our manual into more than nine chunks).

2021-10-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* arch/misc/misc.am:
	(arch_shdeps_sh): Pull file name into a new variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST, shdeps.sed): Ue it.

2021-10-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[nroff]: Support groff's -R flag to run refer(1).

	There's no reason not to support calling `refer` with nroff-mode
	documents; typographically, it's less demanding than tbl(1).
	GNU troff(1) supports an incompatible `-R` flag to suppress the
	reading of troffrc{,-end} files, but this is likely not the `-R`
	that users will want--it is most useful for troubleshooting
	troff, and nroff already unconditionally loads a macro file
	{tty-char.tmac}.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Do it.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.1.man:
	* NEWS: Document it.

	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac/groff_man.7.man,

	$(AM_V_GEN) more consistently with the rest of the build.

2021-10-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_error): Format diagnostic
	messages in closer alignment with GNU Coding Standards: don't
	introduce a space between the program name and the input file
	name.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/string_case_xform_errors.sh: Update
	expected output.

2021-10-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (distribute_space): Revert an
	`assert()` I added in commit b93eacd8d7 (5 September); we can
	indeed reach this code with a negative amount of desired space,
	and in fact the "show hyphenation points" trick
	<https://froude.eu/groff/examples/hyphenation-points.html>
	relies upon it.  Add explanatory comment.

2021-10-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* test-groff.in: Add support for sboxes.tmac.

2021-10-11  Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	Include <config.h> before any standard headers.

	Gnulib requires that files that might use Gnulib features (which
	pretty much means every C or C++ source file) must include
	<config.h> first.  Arrange for that.  This will be needed once
	Groff updates to the latest Gnulib; see Bjarni Ingi Gislason's
	problem report in:
	<https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2021-10/msg00008.html>

	The only exception I can see is src/utils/addftinfo/guess.cpp,
	which does not include any standard include file either directly
	or indirectly, and so need not include <config.h>.

	"utf8".

	* tmac/tests/an_MR-works.sh: Drop copy-and-paste cruft from a

	and bracket it with italic corrections if that font is thought
	to be oblique.
	(MR): Add macro to format the text of a man page cross
	reference, and hyperlink it on HTML and terminal output devices

	(initialization): Define `MF` string as `I` if not already set.
	Define `an-lic` and `an-ic` strings as either empty or as

	[andoc,man,mdoc]: Fix Savannah #61266.  Resolve problems in
	batch rendering of man pages to PDF arising from entanglement
	of end-of-input traps, page location traps, continuous rendering

	* tmac/andoc.tmac (reload-doc, reload-man): Remove end-of-input
	traps alongside others.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-end): Only perform flush and "manual" page

	Unconditionally remove the `an-header` trap since the next

	trap) unconditionally, and break the page if the vertical
	drawing position is anywhere but at the top.
	(Os): If the package has just been initialized, call
	`doc-header` to force the page header to be written.
	(doc-end-macro): Remove `doc-header` trap since the next
	document might be using a different macro package.  Break the
	page.  Set flag indicating that manual header placement will be
	required for the next document.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff (doc-setup-header): Only set page
	location traps for the header and footer if not continuously
	rendering.
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff (doc-setup-header): Stop calling
	`doc-header` here if continuously rendering.  Emit an
	unconditional break.  Except for the location of the footer
	trap, the `doc-setup-header` implementations are now identical.

	Refactoring is needed: some macros and registers have misleading
	names, there is some code duplication in mdoc, and some of the
	trap management problems are solved in slightly different ways
	in man(7) and mdoc(7), perhaps unnecessarily.  We also need some
	test scripts to protect us from regressions.  But this fixes the
	rendering problems.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61266>.

	Correct manpage typo/inconsistency.

	be...
	(TC\-LEADER, TC\-MARGIN): ...respectively, for consistency

2021-10-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	code slightly by taking advantage of preprocessor string literal
	concatenation.

2021-10-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Fix `U` enablement override so it actually works the way
	I had in mind.
	- The package proper enables it by default, but
	- the sample site configuration file switches it off, on the
	  assumption that distributors and users will know better than
	  we do when they get a capable pager in place, and
	- a register setting at the command line (or otherwise prior to
	  the loading of the macro package) is dispositive.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac: Rename URI output device capability register
	from `U` to `mU`.
	(UR, UE, MT, ME): Test both `U` and `mU` before handling
	hyperlinks specially.
	* tmac/an.tmac: If `man.local` did not initialize `U`, switch it
	on.  The hope is that we can drop the stuff in `man.local`
	completely at some point.
	* tman/man.local: Only initialize `U` if it is not already
	defined.

2021-10-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Use OSC 8 hyperlinks.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac: Add registers `mY` (output driver is
	"grotty") and `U` (generate hyperlinks).  `U` is intended to
	apply to hyperlinking support in general, not just grotty's OSC
	8 feature.  If the output driver is either grohtml or grotty,
	make `U` true (`man.local` is read subsequently and can override
	it).
	(UR, MT): Conditionalize diversion production on hyperlink
	support, not grohtml use per se.
	(UE, ME): Generate device control commands for `tty` device to
	emit hyperlinks.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Options): Document -rU.
	(Files) [style]: Add example of `U` register enablement.

	* tmac/man.local: Disable `U` register by default, except on the
	`html` device.

	* NEWS: Add item.

2021-10-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grotty]: Add OSC 8 hyperlink support.

	* src/devices/grotty/tty.cpp: Do it.  Define `OSC` (Operating
	System Command) and `ST` (String Terminator) preprocessor
	symbols for these ECMA-48 (ISO 6429) character sequences.
	(tty_printer::simple_add_char): Add stripped-down alternative to
	`add_char()` member function for cases where we want to use many
	defaults because we're writing a terminal escape sequence, not
	rendering a glyph.  (A function like `add_char()` that takes 8
	arguments of varying types is a code smell--phew!)
	(tty_printer::special): Call `special_link()` member function if
	the device control command is `link`.
	(tty_printer::special_link): Add new member function to generate
	OSC 8 hyperlinks.

	* src/devices/grotty/grotty.1.man: Document it.  Observe in
	multiple places that disablement of SGR escape sequences
	disables OSC 8 too.

	* src/devices/grotty/tests/osc8_works.sh: Test it.
	* src/devices/grotty/grotty.am (TESTS, grotty_TESTS): Run test.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Ship test.

	* NEWS: Add item.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60666>.  Thanks to Steffen
	Nurpmeso for supplying a proof-of-concept.  (I went with my own
	implementation, though, so blame me if it breaks.)

	[troff]: Convert special character glyphs corresponding to
	Unicode Basic Latin ("ASCII") code points to those code points
	when they occur in device escapes.  (They should be correct for
	IBM code page 1047 as well, but this is untested.)  This is
	necessary for encoding URLs in device control commands.  Special
	character identifiers are presumed to be the defaults documented
	in groff_char(7); this is a design gap that we should consider
	addressing.  (We don't have a way to ask "is this the special
	character corresponding to Unicode basic Latin code point X?")

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (encode_char): Do it.

2021-09-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man, mdoc]: Draw line after each page more consistently in
	continuous rendering mode.

	* tmac/an.tmac (an-bp): Move responsibility for line-drawing
	after each document from here...
	(an-end): ...to here.  Refactor; drop
	`an-do-draw-line-after-document` register in favor of testing
	`\n[.F]` for nullity; if it is not null, then another document
	is due to be processed (in fact, `.F` already contains its file
	name), and we need to draw a separating line.  If it is null, we
	have reached the end of input and none is necessary.

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff.tmac (doc-setup-page-layout):
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff.tmac (doc-setup-page-layout): Save
	configured line length in new register `doc-line-length`.
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common.tmac (doc-end-macro): Port the above
	man(7) feature to mdoc(7); draw a line of this length after each
	document if continuously rendering.

2021-10-01  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	[ms]: Update footnote handling documentation.

	* tmac/groff_ms.7.man: Make some linguistic style adjustments.
	(FP): Document it; see <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61022>.
	(FS-MARK): Likewise, document this recently added feature.

2021-10-01  Keith Marshall  <keith.d.marshall@ntlworld.com>

	[ms]: Support user-defined TOC leader style.

	* tmac/s.tmac (toc*leader-char): Rename it as...
	(TC-LEADER): ...this; within PX, leave it unchanged, if
	predefined.
	(TC-MARGIN): New numeric register; if predefined, leave it
	unchanged, otherwise define as \w'000'; use it instead of
	hard-wired definition, within PX; see
	<https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61157>.

	* tmac/groff_ms.7.man (TC-LEADER, TC-MARGIN): Document them.

	[pic]: Update input file name correctly.

	* src/preproc/pic/troff.cpp (troff_output::set_location): Copy
	the inbound file name argument with `strdup()` and store pointer
	to this copy in `last_filename` instead of aliasing argument.
	(troff_output::~troff_output): `free()` the memory allocated by
	`strdup()` in destructor.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61206>.  Pointer
	assignment instead of a string copy was being performed, which
	means that after its initial assignment, `last_filename` always
	shared its value ultimately with the `current_filename` pointer
	{a libgroff symbol}, so `strcmp()` was always being performed on
	identical pointers.  Problem appears to date back 30+ years, to
	the dawn of our repo history.

2021-09-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* font/devlj4/S: Make font name consistent with file name.

2021-09-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Throw error if a font
	description file is missing a `spacewidth` directive, since it
	is now re-documented as mandatory.  Atypically, we don't return
	false in this scenario; instead we proceed with the existing
	logic to compute a space width for the font based on typical
	practices for Western alphabetic fonts (see, e.g.,
	<https://type.today/en/journal/spaces>.

	* font/devdvi/EX:
	* font/devdvi/MI:
	* font/devdvi/S:
	* font/devdvi/SA:
	* font/devps/EURO: Add `spacewidth` directive to font
	description files we ship that were missing it.  We use the same
	values that libgroff would have computed, so there should be no
	visible difference.

2021-09-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Mark `$(TEST_SUITE_LOG)` as `.PRECIOUS`.  This
	prevents the test suite log from being deleted if there are any
	failures.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Refactor to make it easier to generalize a per-package
	scoring mechanism.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Convert `inferred_main_package` from
	scalar to list.  Add scalar `selected_main_package` to store a
	"winner" from the list of main packages inferred.
	(push_main_package): Add subroutine to populate
	`inferred_main_package`.
	(do_line, infer_man_or_ms_package): Update to use
	`push_main_package`.
	(construct_command): Rewrite to select a main package from the
	list `inferred_main_package`, taking user-supplied arguments
	into account as an overriding factor.  Drop now-unused `msupp`
	list.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): If the `-I` option is given,
	run the grn preprocessor and pass it an `-M` option with `-I`'s
	argument.

	* NEWS:
	* src/roff/groff/groff.1.man (Options): Document it.  Also
	document that `-I` options are passed to the output driver.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (do_line): Don't strip groff-style
	comments \# if AT&T compatibility mode is enabled.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Perform more font description file validation.  Our
	documentation said that the `name` directive was mandatory but
	we didn't actually enforce this.  Also be more specific in our
	complaints of ill-formedness.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Add local Boolean
	variable `saw_name_directive`.  Rename `had_charset` to
	`saw_charset_directive` for symmetry.  Emit distinct diagnostics
	for `spacewidth` and `slant` directives having a missing,
	non-numeric, or out-of-range argument.  Emit diagnostic if the
	file lacks a `name` directive.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (struct text_file): Rename member
	variable `size` to `linebufsize` for clarity (it's certainly not
	the size of the text file).
	(text_file::text_file): Initialize `linebufsize` in constructor.
	(text_file::next_line): Allocate new `buf` using `linebufsize`
	instead of magic number (which was also stored to `size`, making
	it only semi-magic, I guess).  Rename local variable `i` to
	`length` since it is in fact the length (in `char`s) of the
	string stored in `buf`.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Revisit fix for Savannah #61173.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (text_file::text_file): Restore
	setting of `lineno` member variable to `0` in constructor
	initializer list, but...
	(text_file::next_line): ...unconditionally increment it every
	time through this member function's outer loop.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Align diagnostic message format with libgroff.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (fatal_with_file_and_line): Report
	the program name if one is defined.
	(fatal_with_file_and_line, error_with_file_and_line,
	debug_with_file_and_line): Report the line number of the input
	file only if it is positive, so that other values can be used
	for "whole file" complaints.  See commit cd0457b6, 17 September.

2021-09-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Drop redundant diagnostic.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Drop redundant
	diagnostic; a missing `charset` directive is already checked for
	later, circa line 998.

2021-09-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Fix code style nits.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::font): Use initializer list
	as much as possible in constructor.
	(font::unit_scale, font::get_width, font::get_height,
	font::get_depth, font::get_italic_correction,
	font::get_left_italic_correction,
	font::get_subscript_correction, font::get_character_type,
	font::get_code, font::get_special_device_encoding): These member
	functions rely on the font being either indexed or associated
	with an output device that uses the `unicode` directive in its
	`DESC` file.  The compiler doesn't know this, so annotate the
	`abort()` calls that conclude them.  Add an `assert()` before
	each one to more usefully describe the violated invariant in the
	event this unreachable code is somehow reached.
	(font::get_width): Annotate special meaning of zero zoom factor.

2021-09-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/include/font.h (UNDEFINED_GLYPH): Use idiomatic C++98 null

	[grohtml]: Fix compiler warning and dead store.

	* src/devices/grohtml/post-html.cpp (html_printer::special):
	Update call of `font::load_font()` to stop passing obsolete
	parameter (deleted by me in 2dff87d3, 17 September).  The value
	stored to the parameter by that function was never read anyway,
	so also get rid of the variable that contained it.

2021-09-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/include/font.h (font::scan_papersize): Demote return type
	from `int` to `bool`.
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::scan_papersize): As above.
	Use Boolean instead of integer literals.  Also rename `FILE`
	stream pointer from `f` to `fp` and perform an explicit
	comparison against the idiomatic C++98 null pointer constant.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff, troff]: Slightly refactor device and font description
	file loading.  Remove dead code.

	* src/include/font.h (font::load_font): Drop second parameter.
	It was never used for its intended purpose.
	(load): Drop first parameter; likewise.
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load, load): As above.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (struct text_file): Rename
	`skip_comments` to `recognize_comments`.  Demote that and
	`silent` from `int` to `bool`.
	(text_file::text_file): Use Boolean rather than integer literals
	in constructor.
	(text_file::next_line, font::load): Apply above renaming.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Rename parameter from
	`head_only` to `load_header_only` to be more communicative.
	Drop test of font description file name being `DESC`; this code
	was not being reached.  Stop throwing errors from this function
	on failure to open the file; the caller will handle this when it
	sees our false return value.  Rename local variable `command` to
	`directive` for alignment with our documentation.  Replace "I
	dont think this should happen" test and comment with `assert()`.
	(struct table): Rename member from `command` to
	`numeric_directive` to indicate its specificity, tracking only a
	subset of valid `DESC` file directives.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load, font::load_desc):
	Remove redundant assignments to the member variable formerly
	known as `skip_comments`.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load_desc): Rename local
	variable `directive_found` to `numeric_directive_found` to
	clarify logic.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (mount_font_no_translate): Simplify
	call of `font::load_font`.  The `not_found` in-out parameter
	which was so agonizingly passed up through layers of library
	calls was never actually read.  Drop code that has been `#if
	0`-ed out since 1993.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load_desc): Clear line
	number before emitting whole-file validity diagnostics.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load_desc): Emit correct

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61174>.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Increase validation of device and font description

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Validate the syntax

	directive that is missing arguments and for a first argument
	that can't be interpreted as a valid number.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Make error reporting more flexible.

	* src/libs/libgroff/error.cpp (do_error_with_file_and_line):

	number.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Add information to diagnostics.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load): Drop unused argument

	that is given an unparsable number.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Tweak code style.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (trim_args, font::load,
	font::load_desc): Compare pointer explicitly to null pointer
	literal `0` instead of using logical complementation.
	(font::load, font::load_desc): Swap order of null pointer
	equality comparisons when a typo or thinko could lead to lvalue
	assignment.

2021-09-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Use idiomatic C++98 null pointer constant.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (text_file::error,

	* src/libs/libgroff/fontfile.cpp (font::image_generator):

	* src/libs/libgroff/tmpfile.cpp (temp_init::temp_init):
	* src/libs/libgroff/tmpname.cpp (gen_tempname): Use `0` literal
	instead of `NULL` to represent a null pointer; this was
	idiomatic in C++98 and is mostly the practice elsewhere in
	groff.  Also swap order of null pointer equality comparisons
	when a typo or thinko could lead to lvalue assignment.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (input_stack::diversion_state,
	input_stack::get_diversion_state, charinfo::contains,

	[libgroff]: Boolify more interfaces.

	* src/include/font.h (font::unit_scale):
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::unit_scale): Demote return
	type from `int` to `bool`.  Use Boolean literals instead of

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (struct text_file): Rename `next`
	member function to `next_line`.  Demote its return type from

	[grn, groff, troff]: Communicate better when device DESC file
	can't be loaded.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::load_desc): Stop writing
	diagnostic to standard error.
	* src/preproc/grn/main.cpp (getres):
	* src/roff/troff/troff.cpp (main): Replace "sorry, I can't
	continue" fatal diagnostic with a more informative message.
	Instead say which device's DESC file the program was trying to
	open, which might reveal a user's logic error or typo.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Replace "invalid device" text
	of fatal diagnostic similarly.  I think it is more helpful to
	indicate the operation that failed rather than saying the device
	was invalid, particularly since there are other ways for a
	device description to be invalid even if a DESC file is found
	and loaded.

2021-09-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Throw warning diagnostic if device DESC file attempts
	to load unavailable fonts.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (main): Take advantage of new Boolean
	return values of `mount_style()` and `mount_font()` to produce
	warning diagnostics if mounting a style or font as directed by
	the DESC file fails.  Explain in a comment why, at present, this
	style mount warning will never actually trip.

2021-09-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Lift font mounting diagnostic messages to be closer to
	their user-controlled contexts to provide more information.  In
	many cases no diagnostic was being thrown at all when an
	unavailable font was requested by name, which is the method most
	users prefer, and which meant that failures resulting from typos
	in font names for many requests (`uf`, `fschar`, `rfschar`,
	`special`, `fspecial`, `fzoom`, `bd`, `tkf`, `cs`) were going
	unreported.  Further, promote these font warnings to errors
	because the request will utterly fail to do what was requested
	with no reasonable fallback.  Possibly, they were formerly
	warnings because at the low level they were being emitted, they
	could also have originated from unavailable fonts encountered in
	device description files, and while that's bad news, it results
	in no formatting problems if it doesn't affect fonts that an
	input document actually uses.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (struct font_lookup_info): New struct
	keeps the font name or position requested, and the position of
	successful font lookup.
	(font_lookup_info::font_lookup_info): Add constructor.
	(font_lookup_error): New function builds error message using a
	`font_lookup_info` struct and a message argument.
	(get_fontno): Rename to...
	(has_font): ...this.  Add argument to take a pointer to a
	`font_lookup_info` struct.  Return a `bool` indicating whether
	the lookup succeeded.  Place former `int` return value into the
	struct instead.  Populate the other struct members with the
	requested font name or position, as appropriate.
	(mount_font_no_translate): Stop throwing warning diagnostic here
	if a font cannot be loaded.  Instead, throw them...
	(font_position): ...here, and...
	(underline_font, define_font_special_character,
	remove_font_special_character, read_special_fonts,
	font_special_request, font_zoom_request, bold_font, track_kern,
	constant_space): ...here, using `font_lookup_info` structs and
	`has_font()`.
	(remove_font_special_character): Stop returning early if font
	lookup fails; it's gratuitously inconsistent with other similar
	functions (save one, which has a reason to be different).
	(define_font_special_character): Return early if font lookup
	fails and say why in a comment (we can't `skip_line()`).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59522>.

	* [libgroff, troff]: Further boolify.

	* src/include/font.h (load_font, font): Demote parameters from
	{pointer to} `int` to `bool` and update default literal from
	integer to Boolean (except for the pointer).  Update comment.
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (load_font, load): Similarly.

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (mount_font):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (mount_font): Demote return type from

	* src/roff/troff/node.h (mount_style):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (mount_style): Promote return type
	from `void` to `bool`.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (mount_font_no_translate): Demote
	return type and `check_only` parameter from `int` to `bool` and
	use Boolean rather than integer literals with them.
	(check_font): Update call site of `mount_font_no_translate` to
	use Boolean literal.
	(font_position): Indicate that "error" is ignored by casting
	return value of `mount_font` to void instead of using a comment.
	(style): Cast return value of `mount_style` to `void`.

2021-09-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add `.DELETE_ON_ERROR` special target; both GNU
	and FreeBSD make(1)s support it so maybe it will be portable
	enough.  This avoids, among other problems, a target appearing
	falsely up-to-date (often as an empty file) when the troff
	process generating it experiences an assertion failure.

2021-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Since June 1991 if not earlier, groff (technically, the refer,
	lookbib, and lkbib programs) has trusted the header contents of
	binary bibliographic index files (canonically generated with
	indxbib(1)) regarding the sizes of the data structures that
	follow in the file, a notorious class of security problem.  In
	July 2013, the Mayhem Team at Carnegie Mellon University
	reported to the Debian Bug Tracking System a problem with
	groff's refer(1) implementation dumping core when reading an
	index file prepared by a fuzzer.

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp (index_search_item::check_header):
	Add new member function to validate the header of an indexed
	bibliography file, returning a string describing in detail the
	first validity problem encountered.
	(index_search_item::load): Perform the foregoing check before
	using any of the size values taken from the header; they are
	relied upon for pointer arithmetic.  If in verification mode
	{using the undocumented `-V` flag to refer(1), lkbib(1), or
	lookbib(1)}, report the details of the problem encountered.
	Regardless of that mode, if there is a validity problem, report
	corruption of the index file and abandon it, forcing fallback to
	the text version of the corresponding bibliography file.

	Fixes <https://bugs.debian.org/716109>.

2021-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp
	(index_search_item::get_invalidity_reason): Don't complain about
	a last list element being nonnegative if the list size was zero
	in the first place, as can happen with an empty index.  More
	seriously from a language standpoint, avoid reading through a
	negative array index (this can escape a compiler's attention
	because we're reading from the midst of a heap-allocated or
	`mmap()`ed region, but it's still a code smell).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61144>.

2021-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp (index_search_item::load,
	index_search_item::get_invalidity_reason,
	index_search_item::add_out_of_date_file): Clarify diagnostic
	messages.  Make it more obvious when we're complaining of a
	problem in an indexed bibliographic database file (rather than a
	plain text one).  Dial down the amount of Unix jargon a little.

2021-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libbib]: Partially boolify.

	* src/include/search.h:
	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp:
	* src/preproc/refer/refer.cpp:
	* src/utils/lkbib/lkbib.cpp:
	* src/utils/lookbib/lookbib.cpp: Demote `verify_flag` from an
	`int` to a `bool`, rename it to `do_verify`, use Boolean
	instead of integer literals with it, and update call sites.

	* src/libs/libbib/index.cpp: Rename `do_verify()` member
	function to `get_invalidity_reason()` (it returns a string).
	Demote `load()` from `int` to `bool`; do the same for `verify()`
	and rename it to `is_valid()` as well.  Use Boolean instead of
	integer literals with them.
	(index_search_item::is_valid, make_index_search_item): Update
	call sites of renamed member functions.

2021-09-12  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/libs/libbib/map.c (mapread): Compare return value of
	`mmap()` to `MAP_FAILED` instead of `(char *)-1`.  `MAP_FAILED`
	is documented in POSIX Issue 5 a.k.a. SUSv2
	<https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/mmap.html>
	{1997} and should be portable enough by now.

2021-09-11  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Clamp negative tab stop positions to zero instead of
	throwing an assertion failure.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (tab_stops::distance_to_next_tab):
	Replace `assert` with clamping logic, ensuring that `lastpos`
	can never be negative.  While negative tab stop positions don't
	make much sense (they result in zero horizontal motion), user
	input like `.ta T -5` should never provoke an assertion failure.

	(set_tabs): Throw range warning in additional scenario, viz., if
	a repeating tab offset is negative.

	Fixes <https://bugs.debian.org/990406>.  Thanks to наб for the
	report.

	  - `repeated` -> `is_repeating_stop`
	Use Boolean instead of integer literals in assignments to them.

	deprecated.

2021-09-07  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Make `ab` request quiet if given no arguments.  The
	`tm`, `tm1`, and `tmc` requests provide ample flexibility for
	constructing diagnostic messages prior to an error exit, and
	it's convenient to make `ab` itself quiet instead of saying
	"User Abort." as Unix Version 7 troff did.  Further, there is no
	standardization across troffs regarding what `ab` should emit if
	arguments are absent.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (abort_request): Do it.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/ab_works.sh:
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Test it.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (exit_troff, abort_request, do_error,

	literals, respectively.

2021-09-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2021-09-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Boolify members of `token` class.

	  - `zero_width_break` -> `is_zero_width_break`
	(class token): Drop 1991 comment anticipating that member
	function `nspaces` could return "2" for a "double space"; this
	was apparently never implemented.
	(class token): Drop parameter names from declarations; the

	  - Use Boolean literals with them.

	[troff]: Don't adjust nonadjustable lines.  This means that the
	direction from which an output line in adjustment mode "b" (or
	its "n" synonym) is filled with supplemental space is not
	changed if that output line does not require adjustment.  This
	will result in whitespace changes to documents using that
	adjustment mode, and these changes will be plainly visible on
	low-resolution output devices like terminals.

	To illustrate, in the following "A" means an output line
	requiring adjustment; "F" a line that is "full" and does not;
	and "L" and "R" indicate distribution of adjustment spaces from
	the left and right, respectively.

2021-08-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Drop `ad_delete` preprocessor wrapper for the
	`delete` operator.  It has been rendered unnecessary by the
	removal of support for ancient C++ compilers.

	* src/include/lib.h (ad_delete): Drop symbol definition.

	* src/preproc/pic/object.cpp (graphic_object::print_text):
	* src/preproc/refer/ref.cpp (reference::reference,
	reference::merge, reference::insert_field,
	reference::delete_field):
	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (format::add_rows): Port uses of
	`ad_delete` to `delete[]`.

2021-08-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_ARRAY_DELETE): Update `AC_MSG_CHECKING`
	argument to refer to "ISO C++98" instead of "ANSI".  Call
	`AC_MSG_ERROR` (aborting configuration) if the check fails.

2021-08-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Drop support for `ARRAY_DELETE_NEEDS_SIZE`.

	* src/include/lib.h [ARRAY_DELETE_NEEDS_SIZE]: Drop preprocessor
	conditional branch.  This abandons support for certain pre-ISO
	C++98 compilers.  (According to a now-removed comment, unsized
	array deletion was documented in "ARM", meaning _The C++
	Annotated Reference Manual_, published in 1989.)

	* Makefile.am: Undocument preprocessor symbol.

2021-08-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Drop redefinition of `INT_MIN`.

	* src/include/lib.h: Drop redefinition of `INT_MIN`.  It was
	motivated by a bug in the AT&T C++ compiler (cfront), version
	2.0, released in June 1989.  Implementations have had 30 years
	to get this right; assume that they have.

	* PROBLEMS: Drop corresponding item.

2021-08-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Drop long-dead `COOKIE_BUG` logic.

	* src/libs/libgroff/new.cpp (operator new, operator delete):
	Drop preprocessor conditional branches on the `COOKIE_BUG`
	symbol.  This was de-documented, and an autoconf check for its
	necessity removed, way back in groff 1.10 (November 1995).  It
	was relevant only to GCC from versions 2.0 to 2.2.2 (all 1992).

2021-08-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Refactor `font::scan_papersize()`.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::scan_papersize): Ensure
	successful return value of `fgets()` before attempting to parse
	string for paper format.  Convert `test_file` to Boolean and
	rename to `attempt_file_open`.  Quiets GCC `-Wunused-result`
	warning.

2021-08-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[tests]: Apply naming convention.

	* tmac/tests/e_footnotes_work_with_columns.sh: Rename from...
	* tmac/tests/e_footnotes-work-with-columns.sh: ...to this.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Update.

2021-08-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an.tmac (IP): Make code more accessible by using a
	Boolean operator rather than an arithmetic one (assembly
	language programmers are comfortable with the interchangeability
	of subtraction and comparison, but not everyone is).

2021-08-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	groff(7): Document more escapes.

	* man/groff.7.man (Escape short reference): Document
	`\[charNNN]`, `\[uNNNN]`, `\[uNNNN_NNNN...]` escape sequences.
	Revise descriptions of `\O0` and `\O1` escape sequences.
	Document `\O2`, `\O3`, `\O4`, and `\O5` escape sequences.

2021-08-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	groff(7): Fix bug in `\?` escape rendering.

	* man/groff.7.man (ESC?): Fix bug in page-private macro: the
	question mark that ends this uniquely-syntaxed escape sequence
	was not shown with the mandatory escape character before it.
	Problem dates back at least to commit 41b0e794, 19 February
	2007, but possiby to f790bc7a9, 6 January 2002.

2021-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[docs]: Elaborate macro definition discussion.

	Kemper for the report.

2021-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	use_point_size_escape_with_single_digit_arg.sh:
	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose_option_works.sh:
	* tmac/tests/s_IP-indents-using-paragraph-type-size.sh: Export

	Ingi Gislason for the report.

2021-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Treat an empty $GROFF_TYPESETTER as unset.

	* src/libs/libgroff/device.cpp (device_init::device_init): Test
	both returned pointer from `getenv()` and, if that's not null,
	the first character of the string for nullity before assigning
	it to `device`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61068>.

2021-08-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff]: Rename font class member variable.

	* src/include/font.h (font class): Rename `unscaled_charwidths`
	member variable to `use_unscaled_charwidths`: since it is a
	Boolean, make it read more like a logical predicate.

	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::get_width, font::load_desc):
	* src/libs/libgroff/fontfile.cpp (font class): Update
	initialization and assignments.

2021-08-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (get_copy): Demote integer arguments
	to Booleans and use Boolean literals for default values.  Rename
	`defining` to `is_defining`.
	(get_char_for_escape_name, do_define_macro): Update call sites
	that use non-default arguments to use Boolean literals and
	comments to document what's being requested.

2021-08-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am (DOC_GROFF_ONLY): Stop running groff in unsafe
	mode; no documents (in _this_ directory) appear to require it.

2021-08-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grn]: Fix code style issues.

	* src/preproc/grn/hgraph.cpp:
	* src/preproc/grn/hpoint.cpp:
	* src/preproc/grn/main.cpp:
	* src/preproc/grn/hdb.cpp: Drop use of `register` storage class.

	* src/preproc/grn/hgraph.cpp (len, HGPrintElt, picurve):
	* src/preproc/grn/hdb.cpp (DBRead): Wrap long lines.

	* src/preproc/grn/hgraph.cpp: Rename function from
	`Paramaterize` to `Parameterize`.
	(HGCurve): Update call site.

	* src/preproc/grn/main.cpp (add_file): Drop redundant cast in
	`realloc()` call.
	(conv, interpret): Use standard English in diagnostic messages.

2021-08-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/grn/hdb.cpp: Perform more input validation.
	Improve diagnostics by taking advantage of libgroff
	infrastructure and tracking the line number of the input file.
	Add global `lineno`.
	(DBRead): Increment `lineno` after reading newlines from input.
	Call `error_with_file_and_line()` instead of `error()`.  If
	input reports a negative length for the text (string) to follow
	in the file, exit with a fatal diagnostic.  Check for EOF while
	reading text string.
	(DBGetType): Convert `fprintf()` call for warning diagnostic to
	`warning_with_file_and_line()`.
	(DBRead, DBGetType): Add contextual information to diagnostic
	messages.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?61043>.  Thanks to
	Savannah user eqkws for the report.

2021-08-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/grn/main.cpp (usage): Update usage message.

2021-08-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grn]: Add and use `malloc()` wrapper.

	* /src/preproc/grn/main.cpp (grnmalloc): New function takes
	argument of `size_t` type and constant string argument to
	describe what is being allocated.  Return non-null pointer from
	`malloc()`, otherwise call `fatal()`, describing what was being
	allocated and the problem reported by the system.

	* src/preproc/grn/hdb.cpp (DBCreateElt):
	* src/preproc/grn/hpoint.cpp (PTMakePoint):
	* /src/preproc/grn/main.cpp (main, interpret): Migrate
	`malloc()` callers to `grnmalloc()`.

2021-08-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/grn/hdb.cpp (DBRead): Check return value of
	`sscanf()` and call `fatal()` if no conversions succeeded.  The
	blithe discard of a useful return value is bad enough, but this
	one took place inside a do-while such that it could loop
	forever trying fruitlessly to parse two doubles out of strings
	that didn't contain them (the loop never checked the EOF status
	of the file stream from which it was reading, and relied on
	`fgets()` to keep advancing the stream pointer).  Discovered
	while root-causing Savannah #61043.

2021-08-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Resolve compiler warnings relating to format string security and
	ISO C++98 conformance.

	* src/preproc/eqn/delim.cpp (define_extensible_string):
	* src/preproc/pic/pic.ypp (do_sprintf): Use #pragma to silence
	GCC "format-nonliteral" warning and explain why our usage is
	safe in a comment.

	* src/preproc/preconv/preconv.cpp (detect_file_encoding): Use
	`l` modifier to `%u` `fprintf()` conversion instead of `z`, and
	cast return values of `size_t` to unsigned long; "ISO C++98
	does not support the ‘z’ gnu_printf length modifier" (it doesn't
	support `ll` either).  N.B. this is debugging output only.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (synopsis):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (usage): Repeat variadic argument for
	`%s` conversion in `fprintf()` call because "ISO C++98 does not
	support %n$ operand number formats".

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Initialize adjustment and hyphenation
	mode enums without commas at the end of the enumeration lists.

2021-08-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Clean up the interface between `an-footer` and `BT`, and
	HTML header and footer suppression generally.  Move
	responsibility for checking the `ps4html` register from the
	latter to the former.  This is not something a `BT` redefiner
	{see groff_man(7)} should have to worry about.

	* tmac/an.tmac (BT): Drop test of `ps4html` register and early
	return.
	(an-header, an-footer): Return immediately if
	`an-suppress-header-and-footer` is true.  Remove conditional on
	`an-is-output-html`.
	(initialization): Define `an-suppress-header-and-footer`
	register; true if `an-is-output-html` is true, or if `ps4html`
	is defined.

2021-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_resolution): Unbrace a
	single-statement `while` loop per prevailing coding style.  Add
	comments noting how we aren't parsing DESC files _precisely_ as
	our documentation specifies.

2021-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Convert font class `int` members to `bool` where appropriate.

	* src/include/font.h (font class): Demote integers to Booleans
	and use Boolean literals where possible.  Rename some member
	variables to look like logical predicates.
	  - contains()
	  - is_special()
	  - has_ligature()
	  - tcommand -> has_tcommand
	  - unscaled_charwidths
	  - pass_filenames
	  - use_charnames_in_special
	  - is_unicode
	  - special (private)
	* src/libs/libgroff/font.cpp (font::font): Construct object
	using Boolean literal.
	(font::contains):
	(font::is_special):
	(font::has_ligature): Convert return type to `bool`.
	(font::load):
	(font::load_desc): Assign to member variables using Boolean
	literals.
	* src/libs/libgroff/fontfile.cpp: Initialize appropriate globals
	using `bool` type and Boolean literals.
	* src/roff/troff/troff.h:
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (main):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (troff_output_file::put_char_width):
	Rename `tcommand_flag` to `device_has_tcommand` to suggest a
	logical predicate, and to emphasize the formatter's concern with
	what the output device can accept in the intermediate output
	language.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Initialize `device_has_tcommand`
	global using `bool` type and Boolean literal.

2021-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Clarify breadth of application of `ll` macro.

	* doc/meref.me: Document application of .ll macro only to the 3

	* tmac/e.tmac (@C, xl, ll): Update comments.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55060>.

2021-08-13  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Thanks to Dave Kemper and Bjarni Ingi Gislason for help tracking
	this bug down.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55081>.

	* tmac/cs.tmac:
	* tmac/de.tmac:
	* tmac/fr.tmac:
	* tmac/it.tmac:
	* tmac/sv.tmac: Update ms package localization to use an

	mode for the pattern files, plus 2 as is traditional in ms).

2021-08-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac (1c): Place comment escape sequence immediately
	after macro argument.  (When redefining a request, one needs to
	remember that request arguments are not parsed exactly as macro
	arguments are.)  Quiets "-w tab" warning.

2021-08-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Fix misleading documentation claim; gremlin(1) pictures
	cannot be included directly; they must be preprocessed with
	grn(1).

	* doc/meref.me:

2021-08-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_me.7.man: Document `n1` and `n2` macros.

2021-08-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[me]: Fix PS/n1 combination diagnostic spew and apparent logic
	error.

	* tmac/e.tmac (@h): Place comment escape sequence immediately
	after macro argument.  (When redefining a request, one needs to
	remember that request arguments are not parsed exactly as macro
	arguments are.)
	(n2): Prefix with `do` requests using long register names.
	(n2): Add macro-local register `|l` to store length of first
	argument.  Don't attempt to extract a substring beyond the
	bounds of its source, which produces a warning diagnostic.
	(&&): Define no-op macro for use as end macro in nested macro
	definition.
	(PS): Fix unbalanced-else diagnostic by changing `if` to `ie`.
	(PS): Initialize `PS_nm_cnt` register to 0 instead of relying on
	implicit definition.
	(PS): Prefix with `do` definition of long macro name.
	(PS): Indent call of end macro.
	(PS): Add comment after escaped space.
	(PS, PF): Prefix with `do` call of long macro name.

2021-08-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

2021-08-06  Dave Kemper <saint.snit@gmail.com>

	GNU pic recognizes two possible endings of a pic block: .PE or
	.PF.  This fact was documented in doc/pic.ms but not in the pic
	man page.  The minimal pic implementation provided by pic.tmac
	also did not include a .PF definition.

	* src/preproc/pic/main.cpp (main): Add dummy definition of `PF`
	macro.
	* tmac/pic.tmac (PF): Add macro that performs indentation only.
	(PE): Call PF for indentation.

	* doc/pic.ms (Interface to [gt]roff/How Scaling is Handled):
	* src/preproc/pic/pic.1.man (Description, Options): Mention `PF`
	in addition to `PS` and `PE`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60504>.

	* tmac/refer-ms.tmac:
	* tmac/s.tmac (fn@init, @PP): Rename strings
	`fn@sup-{start,end}` to `fn@mark-{start,end}.  This makes it
	more clear that the strings are brackets for the footnote
	marker, and not so much to do with the note text.  Further, in
	nroff mode, they aren't superscripts at all, but bracket glyphs.

2021-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/preproc/refer/refer.1.man (Examples): Add section.

	Addresses part of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?57667>.

2021-08-02  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/refer-ms.tmac: Use `fn@sup-{start,end}` instead of

	This improves the appearance of the default labels on nroff
	devices.  Continues commit caeede07, 1 May.

2021-08-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tman/an-ext.tmac (EX, EE): Stop manipulating hyphenation.
	It's redundant since disabling fill mode already prevents
	automatic breaking, and therefore automatic hyphenation.
	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Description/Document structure
	macros) <EX, EE>: Update documentation.

2021-08-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Update authorship credits.  I appear

2021-07-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Refactor through relocation and

	  - `@main_package` -> `&construct_command`
	Rename some objects for clarity.
	  - `%Groff` -> `%score`

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (do_line): When matching macro/request
	names, accept any non-whitespace character (Perl: \S) instead of
	just a word-constituent character (Perl: \w), since roff
	identifiers can contain unusual characters (refer(1) and
	groff_me(7) illustrate some real-world cases).

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Refactor macro package inference.
	  - Stop manually populating `Groff` hash.  (It's itching for a
	    rename.)
	  - Stop calling now-dead subroutine `infer_macro_packages`.
	(do_line): Always store the names of all macros called to the
	`Groff` hash, incrementing it.  Now it's a proper scoreboard.
	Populate `inferred_main_package` from here upon encountering
	characteristic (i.e., uniquely named) macros of each package.
	Bug fix: drop "SP" from list of characteristic mom(7) macros;
	it's shared with mm(7).
	(infer_man_or_ms_package): Update comment.  Return 0 (false) if
	document appears to be "raw", using no full-service macro
	package.
	(infer_macro_packages): Delete; do_line() does this work.

2021-07-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Refactor preprocessor inference.
	  - Add new list, `inferred_preprocessor`.
	  - Drop preprocessor-related keys from `Groff` hash.
	  - Drop scalar `inside_tbl_table`.
	(do_line): Set up hash `preprocessor_for_macro`.  Detect
	preprocessor macros the way the preprocessors do, explained in a
	comment.  Respect AT&T compatibility mode when doing so.  Build
	list of inferred preprocessors.  This replaces the extensive and
	gaseous series of `if` statements that manipulated the `Groff`
	hash.
	(infer_preprocessors): Completely replace.  Set up a hash
	`option_for_preprocessor` mapping preprocessor names to groff
	options (where applicable).  Append to `command` and
	`preprocessor` lists as appropriate.  Sort the preprocessor
	options so they don't move around in the argument list depending
	on the order of their macros' appearance in the input.

	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Update test cases to
	expect preprocessor options to show up in sorted order.

2021-07-31  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Drop dead code.  Delete global
	hash `preprocs_tmacs`, unused since commit b0de53c9, 30 June.

2021-07-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Fix code nit.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (get_image_generator):
	Type-qualify `keyword_len` as `const` to encourage the compiler
	to compute this value (the length of a string literal) at build
	time.

2021-07-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Add static `image_filename_len` to
	store length of cached image file name, so we don't wastefully
	recompute its length every time one is re-used.
	(suppress_node::tprint): Compute image file name length only
	when saving a new image file name.  Use saved length in later
	expressions.
	(min): Drop unused inline function.

2021-07-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Fix regression (breaking important pdfmark/pdfroff
	features) caused by my commit
	e876d4bfd193abb9a7d1fb6e76519349bded482a, 27 July.  An empty
	image file name is in fact semantically valid when writing a
	bounding box; pdfmark uses such boxes to frame hyperlinks.
	Avoid null pointer dereference by initializing `image_filename`
	to an empty string literal.  Thanks to Tadziu Hoffman and Keith
	Marshall for their patient explanations.

2021-07-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor some internal functions.

	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Rename two functions that have only
	one caller.
	  - get_reg_int -> get_register
	  - get_reg_str -> get_string
	We now have:
	(get_register, get_string): Use `assert()` aggressively because
	these are deeply internal and validation is imperative.  Get rid
	of diagnostic messages (one of which perpetuated the dubious
	"number register" nomenclature) accordingly.
	(fetch_register): Also rename `prev_value`, misleadingly
	specific and seemingly copy-and-pasted out of a context where an
	auto-increment or -decrement might have been applied.  It's just
	the `value`.
	(suppress_node::tprint): Update call site.

2021-07-29  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Refactor `get_value` member functions.  Given their
	names and popular "getter/setter" paradigms from many OO
	languages, the return type is misleading.  Change it from `int`
	to `bool` since it returns only a success/failure status and
	modifies an argument (passed by reference) to deliver the
	requested data.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.h (reg, variable_reg):
	* src/roff/troff/div.cpp (page_offset_reg, page_length_reg,
	vertical_position_reg, high_water_mark_reg,
	distance_to_next_trap_reg, page_number_reg, no_space_mode_reg):
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (int_env_reg, vunits_env_reg,
	hunits_env_reg, horizontal_place_reg):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (writable_lineno_reg):
	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (reg, number_reg, variable_reg): Update
	class and member function definitions to reflect the new type.
	Update member function definitions to return appropriate Boolean
	literals instead of 0 and 1.

2021-07-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Fix Savannah #60981.  Refactor device description
	file handling and make it more robust.  Make pre-grohtml's
	-F option work as documented and honor device description file
	semantics documented in groff_font(5).

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Store partial filespecs of HTML
	and PostScript device files in constant strings.
	(get_resolution): Initialize `res` to zero.  Only `free()` the
	pointer `pathp` if `open_file()` succeeded (populating it).
	Stop checking for valid `sscanf()` conversions of an integer to
	store in `res`, and don't return early.  Instead process the
	whole DESC file; per our Texinfo manual and groff_font(5),
	"Later entries in the file ... override previous values."
	(get_image_generator): Add new function, paralleling
	`get_resolution()`, replacing open-coded logic in `main()`.
	Only the body of the `while` loop significantly differs.
	Instead of using `sscanf`, process the input character by
	character matching the keyword and {1,} spaces or tabs
	after it.  Whatever follows in `linebuf` must be the program
	name.
	(imageList::createPage): Add `assert()` to cause failure if an
	empty image generator program gets this far, because it creates
	repeated messes if it does.  (Something isn't checking exit
	statuses.)
	(main): Condense `image_gen` collection to a function call, a
	null pointer check, and a fatal diagnostic.  Add a sanity check
	and a fatal diagnostic if the PostScript resolution is garbage.
	{It's initialized to -1 and `get_resolution()` will return 0 if
	it doesn't find one.}

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60981>.

	[grohtml]: Delete or rename `debug` symbols to avoid clash with
	new `debug` function in libgroff.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Update a comment to refer to
	"debugging" mode.  Rename static global from `debug` to
	`debugging`.
	(html_system, imageList::createPage, imageList::createImage,
	print_args, char_buffer::do_html, char_buffer::do_image,
	scanArguments): Update uses of static global.

	* src/preproc/html/pushback.cpp:
	* src/preproc/html/pushback.h: Delete unused `debug` member
	variable.

2021-07-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Fix straggling use of `$1`, which
	might not have a clear meaning in some shells after being
	shifted (what if we just shifted the last argument?).  Also
	`continue` after processing a (groff) option argument, as we
	should make no attempt to parse it.

2021-07-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_suppress): Recast diagnostic
	messages for clarity, to communicate in terms of what the
	escape sequence _is_, and to quote literals expected as input.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (suppress_node::tprint): Recast
	diagnostic to prevent misinterpretation of image "description"
	as being HTML IMG tag alt text or something like that.
	Unfortunately, the new language speaks in terms of internal
	implementation details ("grohtml-info"), but at least that way
	it's easier for a user to decide if they care about it.

2021-07-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Avoid using sprintf() with user-controlled format
	string.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (makeFileName): Add comment
	noting need for implementation synchrony between this function,
	which generates \O5 escape sequences, and troff's
	suppress_node::tprint member function, which interprets them.
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp: Rename 2 static globals for clarity.
	  - `last_image_filename` -> `image_filename`
	  - `last_image_id` -> `subimage_counter`
	(suppress_node::tprint): Set up the buffer for image file name
	to be written using a constant rather than an embedded literal.
	Unconditionally initialize the buffer with a string terminator,
	so there is no chance of a read from uninitialized storage.
	Drop unused code involving `tem`.  Drop stale comments.  Clarify
	comment: an `image_filename` doesn't _always_ contain a format
	string, only sometimes.  Replace use of `sprintf` with manual
	construction of a new image filename string.  There are two
	cases, one where a format string {presently "%d"} is present,
	and one where it is not.  If it is present, locate it
	{`percent`}.  This means a limited/bounded image ("subimage") is
	being processed; increment the subimage counter.  Write a new
	image file name preserving the parts before and after "%d" (the
	"prefix" and "suffix", and replacing only the middle, using
	`sprintf` with the subimage counter and the (string literal)
	format.  Be mindful of string bounds and memory allocation,
	issuing diagnostics or aborting as necessary.  If the image file
	name does _not_ contain a format string, but needs only to be
	copied, do that (`strcpy`), again instead of using `sprintf`.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60977>.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Fix Savannah #60971.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (makeFileName): Consistently put
	a dash at the end of `macroset_template` whether the image file
	name stem is user-supplied or the default.  Stop adding the dash
	before the image number in `image_template` instead.  This makes
	the image file name format reliable whether the image needs to
	be subdivided (eqn) or not (tbl).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60971>.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Reduce noise to standard error stream.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (imageList::createImage): Fix
	apparent oversight: `EXE_EXT` was not being applied to the
	second of three commands being run in a pipeline (did Windows
	users notice?).  Also issue (undocumented!) `-quiet` option to
	`pnmtopng` to shut up its commentary about counting colors.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Stop discarding standard error output.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp (html_system): Stop sending the
	standard error stream to /dev/null; this just makes debugging
	harder, and doesn't produce much more output for well-formed
	input documents.  Rename `save_stdout` to `saved_stdout`.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grohtml]: Fix misspelled variable.

	* src/preproc/html/pre-html.cpp: Rename `IMAGE_BOARDER_PIXELS`
	to `IMAGE_BORDER_PIXELS`.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[libgroff, troff]: Add debug diagnostic level.

	* src/include/error.h: Declare functions
	`debug_with_file_and_line` and `debug`.
	* src/libs/libgroff/error.cpp: Add `DEBUG` to enum `error_type`.
	(do_error_with_file_and_line): Add case for `DEBUG` in switch.
	(debug, debug_with_file_and_line): Add new functions.

	Do the same for troff since it has a private implementation of
	the diagnostic functions (thanks to `output_warning()`).

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp: Add `DEBUG` to enum `error_type`.
	(do_error_with_file_and_line): Add case for `DEBUG` in switch.
	(debug, debug_with_file_and_line): Add new functions.

2021-07-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/hpftodit/hpftodit.cpp (hp_msl_to_ucode_name,
	unicode_to_ucode_name): Hush "format nonliteral" compiler
	warnings by using a preprocessor-defined string literal as an
	sprintf() format string instead of a C++ variable that just
	compared identically to the same thing.

2021-07-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/hpftodit/hpftodit.cpp (show_symset): Prevent
	sprintf() from overunning a static buffer.  Thanks to Bjarni
	Ingi Gislason for the report.  Resize buffer to be large enough
	to accommodate a 64-bit unsigned int type formatted as decimal.
	Also add assert() before the sprintf() to abort if the int type
	is even larger than that.  Use "%u" conversion instead of "%d"
	since the quantity is unsigned.
	(hp_msl_to_ucode_name): Similar, but for a signed int.
	(unicode_to_ucode_name): Similar, but for a signed int formatted
	as (unsigned) hexadecimal.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60964>.

2021-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Refactor, mostly by relocation.  Move
	locale character set inference logic so that we only run it if
	we have to (`-T` option was invalid or not given and
	`GROFF_TYPESETTER` was not set in the environment or invalid).
	Initalize `T` variable as empty.

2021-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Use Version 7 Unix sh-compatible form
	of parameter expansion; per the GNU Autoconf manual[1], "[o]ld
	BSD shells, including the Ultrix sh, don't accept the colon for
	any shell substitution, and complain and die."  This is also the
	form of such substitutions used elsewhere in the script, so they
	should be mutually consistent.

2021-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Slightly refactor.  Rename formerly
	unused loop index variable from `i` to `arg` to leverage it in a
	later diagnostic message without a separate definition.  Inside
	the loop, expand `arg` instead of positional parameter 1, the
	meaning of which is less obvious after the parameter list is
	shifted by the new `is_option_argument_pending` logic (commit
	2b955c57, 20 July).

2021-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/groff/groff.1.man (Options) <-S>: Fix error: `-S`
	sets safer mode (redundantly) but is not passed to pic and troff
	as was claimed.

2021-07-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/number.cpp (parse_term): Tweak diagnostic
	messages.  When a left operand to a binary operator is empty,
	report the operator in question (helpful for string
	interpolations in complex expressions).  When handling input
	scaling indicators, drop word "this" from "this context", since
	the parser's context might not be clear from a file name and
	line number.  Say "scaling indicator" instead of "scale
	indicator".
	(parse_expr, parse_term): Rename function parameter from
	`scale_indicator` to `scaling_indicator`.

2021-07-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (define_color): Tweak warning
	diagnostics for clarity.  Only one value is expected when
	defining a color in the `gray` color space.  Quote recognized
	color space names when complaining of an unknown one.

2021-07-21  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[nroff]: Pass a supplied `-c` option to groff.  While at present
	this does little more than `-P-c` already achieves, that might
	not be true forever.  Further, there is a distinction between
	ignoring color-related requests in groff input documents and
	ignoring color-related commands in device-independent output.
	This distinction would make it unwise to adapt `-c` to any other
	purpose in nroff in the future.

	* NEWS: Update item from commit dd725dce, 10 February 2020.
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Pass `-c` option to groff in addition
	to synthesizing a `-P-c` option (for grotty) when it is seen.
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.1.man (Options): Document `-c` as an
	option recognized by troff(1).

2021-07-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[nroff]: Support space between option flags and their arguments.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Add new `is_option_argument_pending`
	flag to add an additional state to the option parser.  Set it if
	an argument-requiring option is encountered with no abutting
	argument.  If it is set when a new argument is encountered,
	absorb the argument into the groff option list and clear the
	flag.  Modernize script in a couple of other ways.
	  - Exit with status 2 upon usage errors so that this condition
	    is easily distinguished from a groff abort (which exits with
	    status 1).
	  - Test shell variables for non-nullity with test(1) -n
	    operator instead of a string comparison.
	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose_option_works.sh: Test correct
	construction of groff command using this input form.
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.1.man (Options): Add spaces between
	option flags and option arguments.  Sync metasyntactic variable
	names with groff(1) while we're at it.
	(Description): Drop sentence warning of whitespace prohibition.
	(Exit status): Add new section.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60943>.

2021-07-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (main): Emit error diagnostic if `-d`
	or `-r` option is given a malformed argument.  This prevents a
	string or register with an empty name from being created.

	[groff]: Comment out vestiges of gideal support.  It would be
	lovely to have, but no free (and GPL-compatible) implementation
	has showed up after decades of waiting.  Production of the
	original was a Ph.D. thesis.  Excited by de Moivre's theorem?
	Take a stab at it.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (main): Comment out effect of `-J`
	option.  It remains recognized, but silently ignored (instead of
	attempting to execute a nonexistent preprocessor).
	(synopsis): Add comment reminding us to document the option if
	we ever get the support.
	(help): Comment out documentation of option.

2021-07-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[[gnt]roff]: Make usage messages more accurate.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp (synopsis): Drop `-h` and `-v` from
	normal operation synopsis.  Sort options in en_US lexicographic
	order.  Tighten presentation of alternate usage forms.
	(help): Document longer forms of `-d` and `-r`.
	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Report `$prog` instead of "nroff"
	literal.  Refer to `-P` option argument as "arg" instead of
	"opt", for consistency with groff usage message.  Use opposite
	case from option letter for option argument.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (usage): Put brackets around options.
	Sort options in en_US lexicographic order.  Drop `-v` from
	normal operation synopsis.  Use opposite case from option letter
	for option argument.  Put operand name in capitals.  Set valid
	usage forms on one physical line each (see 89648fb4, 5 June).
	Add synopsis line for alternate usage forms.

	[troff]: Refactor environment initialization, switching, and
	copying.

	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp: Rename struct `env_list` to
	`env_list_node` since it describes a node of a singly-linked
	list.  Remove constant `NENVIRONMENTS` and array `env_table`.
	Add static symbol `default_environment_name` to replace string
	literal.
	(init_environments): Stop initializing `curenv` through
	`env_table`.  Use `default_environment_name` for that
	initialization and add the default environment to
	`env_dictionary`.
	(environment_switch): Simplify.  Shorten "dummy environment"
	diagnostic message.  Stop creating an integer-named
	environment inside the `env_table` array, only falling through
	to use the `env_dictionary` if the named environment is not a
	valid integer or if the array is full.  Instead use
	`env_dictionary` always.  Drop no longer needed `pop`
	quasi-Boolean integer with extra state to suppress environment
	stack underflow errors.  Instead report the error if underflow
	occurs, regardless of any other circumstance.
	(environment_copy): Simplify.  Stop searching the `env_table`
	array for an environment to copy from, only falling through to
	use the `env_dictionary` if the named environment is not a valid
	integer or if the array is full.  Instead search
	`env_dictionary` always.  Emit "no environment specified to copy
	from" diagnostic only if the `evc` request is given no argument.
	If the source environment to copy from is given but not found,
	emit a new diagnostic naming the nonexistent environment.  Fix
	bug: stop returning early if no copying could be done; instead
	fall through to the end of the function, which calls
	`skip_line()` and prevents anything on the remainder of the
	{invalid} control line from being interpreted.  Problem dates
	back to commit da3b7137, 6 March 2000 (groff 1.16).

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-ditroff:
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff:
	* tmac/mdoc/doc-syms: Bracket macro definitions tightly with
	`eo` and `ec` requests since they were written under this
	assumption.  The files in general were also drafted under the
	assumption that they'd be stripped, so `eo` was in effect for
	broad swaths of the file including portions outside of any macro
	definition where comments were used.  But comments are expressed
	using the escape character!  So we got warnings about an
	undefined '\"' macro, and that was just the beginning of a
	wrecking ball of trouble that smashed through the
	implementation.  Some--but not all--string definitions (and
	appendments) needed to be bracketed with `eo` and `ec` as well,
	to delay interpolation of embedded string names that are not
	defined until macros interpolate them later.  I did what
	appeared necessary to pass our tests and keep -Tutf8 and -Tps
	renderings of tmac/groff_mdoc.7 from changing from their
	strip-influenced output.  Subtle bugs might linger, but some
	won't be the fault of the unstripping process.  (For instance,
	try provoking a usage message on the `Hf` macro.)

	.cp register introduced in commit 6a37bb5f, 17 April 2020.  Now
	the logic is less mysterious.  Also, remove the register used to

	[tmac]: Flesh out Italian localization.

	* tmac/hyphen.it: Add hyphenation patterns from TeX hyph-utf8
	project.
	* tmac/it.tmac:
	  - Revise copyright date to just this year (it had been copied
	    from fr.tmac).
	  - Use grave accents instead of acute ones to indicate stress
	    on word-final vowels.  Per the University of Wikipedia and a
	    sampling of apparently well-typeset Italian language
	    documents online, this appears to be correct.  Yell at me if
	    I'm wrong.
	  - Source latin1.tmac instead of latin9.tmac; Italian doesn't
	    require any letter code points from Latin-9, unlike the
	    French file upon which this one was based, and Latin-1 is
	    less of a pain to work with.
	  - Set the hyphenation mode to 1 instead of 4 for congruence
	    with the requirements of the hyphenation patterns.
	  - Set up hyphenation codes.  This (and sourcing latin1.tmac)
	    might not be necessary as the hyphenation pattern file, of a
	    more recent vintage than the others we're using, is pure
	    ASCII.  However I don't understand these issues perfectly so
	    I am making the conservative choice.  Again per the
	    University of Wikipedia, Italian requires only acute and
	    grave accents, in contrast to the rich French diacritical
	    bouillabaisse.
	  - Set the hyphenation language and load the pattern file.
	  - Add comments in parallel with other localization files and
	    to supply text editors with hints.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Simplify parsing.  Dave Kemper pointed
	out that preprocessors like pic(1) use pretty unsophisticated
	*roff parsing to determine where to perform their textual
	replacements.  My enhancements to support input line
	continuation and cope with brace escapes were thus
	overengineered.  Remove them.
	  - Drop scalars `is_continued_line` and `logical_line`.
	  (do_line): Stop performing logical line concatenation and
	  detecting input line continuation.  Perform operations on
	  `line` instead of `logical_line`.  Stop removing brace
	  escapes.

2021-06-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Refactor input parsing.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl:
	  - Add scalar `use_compatibility_mode` (see below).
	  - Add list `request` to store the names of all requests
	    recognized by groff so that they aren't confused with macro
	    names.
	  - Add scalars `have_seen_first_macro_call` (replaces
	    `before_first_command`, but at global scope),
	    `is_continued_line` and `logical_line`.  The latter two
	    enable us to handle *roff input line continuation correctly.
	  (process_arguments): Set `use_compatibility_mode` if `-C`
	  option specified.
	  (process_input): Refactor to greatly simplify, to not attempt
	  to read the first line of an input file as a special case, and
	  to avoid sending `do_line` an undefined argument (when EOF is
	  reached).
	  (do_first_line): Delete.
	  (do_line): Rewrite the early stages of input parsing.
	  - Concatenate continued input lines, setting
	    `is_continued_line` and returning early as each one is seen,
	    storing the accumulating input in `logical_line`.
	  - Check the input line for the form of comment deposited by
	    Perl's Pod::Man, which uses a highly accented dialect of
	    man(7); if it's present, inflate `man_score` to compensate
	    for the page-private `IX` macro it defines but which
	    duplicates the name and function of a 4.2BSD-era ms(7)
	    extension that would otherwise deceive our scoring
	    mechanism, because Pod::Man produces `IX` calls to
	    metastatic excess.  (An alternative to this kludge is
	    documented in comments: if a "standard" macro is redefined,
	    we could delete it from the relevant lists and hashes.)
	  - Strip *roff comments from input.
	  - Normalize control lines; convert the no-break control
	    character to the regular one and remove unnecessary
	    white space.
	  - Remove brace escapes.
	  - Recognize two-character macro calls when not followed by
	    white space in compatibility mode.
	  - Drop logic that erroneously attempted to infer soelim(1) use
	    from macro calls and request invocations.  The grog(1) and
	    soelim(1) man pages now both explain why such an effort was
	    misguided.
	  - Recognize macro definitions created by .am and .am1 requests
	    {not just .de and .de1}.
	  - Ignore all other *roff requests.
	  - What remains must be a ("standard") macro call, so set
	    `have_seen_first_macro_call`.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.1.man (Limitations): Document a further
	restriction: don't change the escape character, either.

	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Comment out pic-detection
	test on soelim(1).  The pic macro calls are guarded by roff
	control structures and only worked previously by accident
	because grog did not recognize *roff input line continuation,
	now it does and the illusion is dispelled.  (A reliable way to
	fool grog before and after my refactoring is now documented in
	its man page.)

	[grog]: Refactor command-line argument handling.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl:
	  - Drop scalars `groff_opts`, `device`, and `with_warnings`.
	  - Move scalar `pdf_with_ligatures`...
	  (process_arguments): ...here.  Recognize all groff options
	  that take an optionally whitespace-separated option argument
	  and apply the existing "delayed option" handling to them.
	  Push any groff option except `-m` as-is onto the constructed
	  groff command's argument list (`-m` handling is unchanged).
	  Match long option names exactly, not sloppily.  Stop
	  recognizing `--warnings` option.  Emit error diagnostic if
	  unrecognized long option encountered.
	  (infer_device): Delete subroutine and its top-level call site.
	  (help): Undocument `--warnings`.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.1.man:
	  (Synopsis): Use font style macros instead of .OP.  Undocument
	  `--warnings`.
	  (Options): Note that the groff arguments produced by the grog
	  `--ligatures` option are supported only by the `pdf` device.
	  Undocument `--warnings`.  Undocument groff-incompatible
	  restriction on whitespace before option arguments; grog is
	  compatible now.  Simplify discussion in light of simplified
	  grog logic.
	  (Details): Undocument scenario where grog infers multiple
	  main/major/full-service macro packages; this no longer
	  happens.
	  (Examples): Update to no longer illustrate inclusion of `-T
	  ps` option; this no longer happens by default.

	[grog]: Refactor device (`-T` option) handling.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Redeclare `device` as a scalar instead
	of a list.
	(process_arguments): Generalize handling of `-T` and `-m`
	options to permit optional whitespace.  Rename scalar `was_T` to
	`delayed_option`.
	(infer_device): Stop unconditionally adding a `-T ps` argument
	to the generated groff command.  Remove logic that validates any
	given `-T` option argument; instead, let groff fail if a bad one
	is supplied (its own diagnostics in this scenario were improved
	in commit 5a721a30, 27 May).  This makes grog agnostic about any
	differently configured default device in groff itself, and about
	the GROFF_TYPESETTER environment variable.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55301> by getting out of
	the way.

	* src/utils/grog/tests/PF-does-not-start-pic-region.sh:
	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Update expected output.

2021-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.am (grog): Drop sed replacement of unused
	configuration variables @g@, @BINDIR@, @libdir@, and @EGREP@.
	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (process_arguments, construct_command):
	Tweak warning diagnostics to use a style where an empty argument
	will be easy to spot.
	(do_first_line): Stop emitting pseudo-diagnostic (to standard
	output!) if we see a "groff options line" [it's not] of
	incorrect form.  The preprocessor encoding hint convention of
	concern here is particular to man pages, disregarded by at least
	one major implementation thereof (man-db man), and not used by
	other types of roff documents; at this point, we don't yet know
	if the document we're processing is a man page.
	(construct_command): Correct comment and related logic error.
	Clear the inferred main macro package if _any_ `-m` argument
	matching any main macro package is given.  Warn only if what is
	specified doesn't match the inference.

2021-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Heavily refactor.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl:
	  - Drop import of unused module `Data::Dumper`.
	  - Drop unused scalars `Sp` and `correct_tmac`.
	  - Simplify determination of version number.  Drop hash `at_at`
	    which only stored one key, `GROFF_VERSION`.  Initialize
	    scalar `groff_version` to "DEVELOPMENT".  Rename scalar
	    `before_make` to `in_source_tree` and initialize to zero.
	    Update `groff_version` with Automake-determined version
	    variable if it is defined (i.e., grog is not running outside
	    of, or in an unbuilt, groff source or binary distribution).
	  - Drop unused `Mparams` list.  Replace it with new list
	    `requested_package`, which stores the arguments to any grog
	    `-m` options specified by the user.
	  - Rename many objects so that I, and others, can better
	    comprehend their purpose, and for consistent letter casing.
	    . @Command -> @command
	    . @devices -> @device
	    . $Prog -> $program_name
	    . %macros -> %user_macro
	    . $have_any_valid_args -> $have_any_valid_arguments
	    . &handle_args -> &process_arguments
	    . &handle_whole_files -> &process_input
	    . @preprograms -> @preprocessor
	    . &make_groff_device -> &infer_device
	    . &make_groff_preproc -> &infer_preprocessors
	    . &make_groff_tmac_others -> &infer_macro_packages
	    . &make_groff_tmac_man_ms -> &infer_man_or_ms_package
	    . &make_groff_line_rest -> &construct_command
	  - Drop many unused keys in `Groff` hash.
	  - Add new lists, `macro_ms`, `macro_man`, and
	    `macro_man_or_ms` to support new scoring technique to
	    disambiguate input documents between these two packages.
	  - Append the foregoing 3 lists to new list `standard_macro`,
	    and add these as keys to the `Groff` hash.
	  - Add new list `main_package` to keep track of full-service
	    package names.
	  - Add new scalars `man_score`, `ms_score`, and
	    `inside_tbl_table` to aid disambiguation of .TH macro calls
	    and the many macro names shared between man(7) and ms(7).
	  (process_arguments): Strip '-m' off of argument before storing
	  the remainder in `@requested_package`.
	  (do_line): Detect .TH macro call even if white space occurs
	  between the control character and the macro name.
	  (do_line): Inflate `$man_score` by 100 if .TH is the first
	  macro call seen in a document.
	  (do_line): Fix bug; clear `$before_first_command` in correct
	  scope--after any macro call, not just if we saw a .TH as the
	  first macro call.
	  (do_line): Set `$inside_tbl_table` when we see a .TS call.
	  (do_line): Clear `$inside_tbl_table` when we see a .TE call.
	  Also increment `$Groff{'tbl')' again, increasing the "score"
	  of tbl(1) usage evidence.
	  (do_line): Drop a lot of code that manually increments %Groff
	  keys corresponding to man and ms macros.  This is now done
	  differently and elsewhere.
	  (do_line): Drop "P" from list of characteristic mm(7) macros.
	  (do_line): Simplify matching of mom(7) macros (match $command,
	  not $line).  Extend list of characteristic mom(7) macros.
	  (do_line): Increment $Groff{$key} if $key is in
	  @standard_macro.
	  (infer_man_or_ms_package): Rewrite.  Compute a score for each
	  package by counting occurrences of their characteristic
	  macros.  If both have a score of zero, assume that the input
	  is a raw roff document.  If the scores are equal
	  {doc/webpage.ms, startlingly, comes within 1 point of a tied
	  score}, infer ms(7) if 'TH' was never called, and if it was,
	  issue a diagnostic advising user to supply a disambiguating
	  `-m` option.  Otherwise, the scores are unequal: infer the
	  package of the winner.  Set scalar `inferred_main_package`
	  instead of pushing `-m` options onto `@m`.
	  (infer_macro_packages): Set scalar `inferred_main_package`
	  instead of pushing `-m` options onto `@m`.  Explicitly return
	  0 if we fall off the end of the function.
	  (construct_command): Rewrite handling of -m options.  Add new
	  list `msupp` to store supplementary (non-main) macro package
	  arguments.  If a full-service package was explicitly
	  requested, it had better not clash with what we inferred.  If
	  it does, explicitly unset `inferred_main_package` so that the
	  -m arguments are placed in the same order that the user gave
	  them; caveat dictator.  If `--run` option was given, just
	  print the command; don't preface it with __FILE__ and __LINE__
	  noise.
	  - Remove comments documenting shared variables used by
	    subroutines.  These are far from useless but too tedious to
	    keep up to date while the code is in flux.
	  - Note several places for further code review or refactoring
	    with "XXX" comments.
	  - Add Vim modeline.

	grog now passes all its tests and correctly infers arguments for
	all in-tree groff documents (except for a known, and already
	documented in grog(1), false positive detection of soelim in
	soelim(1)).  This refactor also obviates or resolves several
	outstanding Savannah tickets.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?44707> by obviating it;
	grog no longer cares about file name extensions on man pages (or
	any other input).

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55302>; same.  The quality
	of diagnostic messages has been improved as well.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59753>; same.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59664>.  The attached
	patch was a less aggressive refactor of &do_line and %Groff.
	Its author made the following claim for it: "With this patch,
	all 'man', 'me', 'mom, and 'ms' files in the repository are
	correctly identified.  The only example of a 'mm'-file is
	"letter.mm", which is not recognized correctly."  As noted
	above, the present refactor achieves correct recognition of all
	of the files, including letter.mm.

2021-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Perform whole-line
	matches.  Apply DRY principle to expected output.  In
	anticipation of pending changes to grog.pl, uncomment and add
	tests for several in-tree documents.

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Refactor.  Discard filename extension-based inference.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (do_line): Stop saving the control
	character in the matched scalar `command` (the request or macro
	name).  We don't need it, and it simplifies much later matching.
	(handle_file_ext): Delete.
	(top level): Drop call site.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Rename `tmac_ext` scalar to
	`inferred_main_package`.

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (handle_args): Complain less noisily
	and more comprehensibly when given unrecognized groff options.

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Handle "--" argument as documented.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl (handle_args): Rename scalar
	`double_minus` to `no_more_options` so it actually communicates
	something.  Drop openability check of operand encountered after
	"--"; since it's on the operand list, it will be checked later
	{in `handle_whole_files`}.  Stop pushing "--" itself onto the
	`filespec` list.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60834>.

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Revise operand handling, diagnostics, and exit status.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.pl: Track more state so that we can
	process the argument list more intelligently and exit with a
	meaningful status.  Add `had_inference_problem`,
	`had_processing_problem`, and `have_any_valid_args` Boolean
	scalars.
	(fail): Add diagnostic subroutine for serious problems; sets
	`had_processing_problem`.
	(handle_args, handle_file_ext): Stop complaining here about
	unopenable file operands.
	(handle_whole_files): Complain only here, with `fail` if a file
	operand cannot be opened.
	(make_groff_line_rest): Don't exit immediately if there is a
	macro package inference clash, because there might be more
	operands to process.  Instead, set `had_inference_problem`.
	Stop exiting from this subroutine.
	(top level): Only call the inference subroutines if we had a
	valid operand to work with (including an implicit read from
	stdin).  Exit with a status corresponding to the Booleans
	declared above.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.1.man (Exit status): Add section; describe
	semantics of exit status values.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60833>.

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Revise diagnostic messages.

	* src/utils/grog/grog.1.man (err): Rename from this...
	(warn): ...to this.  Prefix diagnostic with command name and
	diagnostic severity level.  The subroutine didn't change the
	exit status and was not used to report serious trouble, so
	"warning" seems appropriate.
	(make_groff_tmac_man_ms): Update call sites.  Modify diagnostic
	wording to stop calling macros "requests".

2021-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/grog.1.man (Limitations): Add subsection
	covering the problem grog has with soelim inference.  Undocument
	groff's -s option as one that can be inferred, because at
	present it cannot be.

	Prompted by Savannah #60421.

2021-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/utils/grog/tests/PF-does-not-start-pic-region.sh:

	* src/utils/grog/grog.am (grog_TESTS): Run test.

2021-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Add smoke test.

	* src/utils/grog/tests/smoke-test.sh: Add test.
	* src/utils/grog/grog.am (grog_TESTS): Run it.
	(TESTS): Add `grog_TESTS`.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Ship test.

2021-06-26  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[grog]: Relocate in source tree.

	* src/roff/grog: Move from here...
	* src/utils/grog: ...to here.

	* MANIFEST:
	* Makefile.am:
	* src/utils/grog/grog.am: Reflect move.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60788>.

2021-06-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (Assigning Formats): Revise discussion.
	Clarify that a format never causes truncation of an interpolated
	magnitude.  Note that non-Arabic number formats cannot be used
	as operands to arithmetic expressions.  Add example of how to
	work around this.

2021-06-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Clarify diagnostics.

	* src/roff/troff/reg.cpp (reg::set_increment): Update diagnostic
	to unabbreviate "auto".
	(reg::alter_format): Update diagnostic to say "assign" instead
	of "alter", since the documentation consistently uses the former
	term.

2021-06-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[troff]: Slightly refactor.  Make the source code slightly more
	accessible by using a `bool` type for a member function's
	default parameter used as a Boolean, and comment it at call
	sites where the default is overridden.

	* src/roff/troff/token.h (token::get_char): Change type of
	parameter from `int` to `bool` and default from 0 to `false`.
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (token::get_char): Update definition.
	* src/roff/troff/env.cpp (hyphen_word):
	* src/roff/troff/node.cpp (remove_font_special_character):
	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_overstrike, do_bracket, next,
	do_define_character, remove_character, get_line_arg,
	encode_char, do_if_request, do_translate, char_flags,
	hyphenation_code, define_class): Update call sites.  Add comment
	indicating meaning of parameter.

2021-06-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (TH): When outputting HTML, write the
	possibly case-transformed (but not yet abbreviated) page title
	as the `title` element instead of the unaltered first argument
	to `TH`.

2021-06-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-abbreviate-title): Define with `de`, not
	`de1`, since it is not intended for call by traps or users.

2021-06-20  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (Tab Stops): Fix erroneous claim; tab stops are
	not set "every half inch across the page".  This is only true in
	"line tabs mode", which is not enabled by default.  The default
	behavior, to keep compatibility with AT&T troff, measures tab
	stops relative to the current position on the input line.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-nroff-u: Set the usekeeps register used by tbl
	to the logical complement of the cR (continuous rendering)
	register.  This prevents blank lines from creeping into tables
	in that mode.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-blank-line-trap, an-leading-space-trap):
	We say in a comment, "Macros ... that are called by traps of any
	kind must be defined with `de1` because they might be called
	from a context where compatibility mode is enabled."  So do it.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-header): Lightly refactor; tighten.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-write-paragraph-tag): Lightly refactor
	for clarity and to reduce code duplicated in both branches of an
	`ie`/`el` structure.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Rename `an-HF-remap-I-style` register to
	`an-remap-I-style-in-headings` for greater clarity.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/mdoc/doc-common-u (doc-header, doc-end-macro): Partially
	revert bf4b3dde (from 20 May); per Ingo Schwarze, continuous
	rendering in mdoc(7) documents has always used only one vee
	between headers, footers, and man page body text.

2021-06-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/en.tmac: Stop using `do` request; it's unnecessary since
	the file is already loaded with compatibility mode off.

2021-06-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[ms]: Fix doc omission; .ID can take an argument.

	* doc/groff.texi (ms Document Control Settings) <DI>:
	Characterize register setting as a _default_.
	(ms Displays and Keeps): Add optional variable "indent" argument
	to syntax summary of ".DS I" and ".ID".  Note that the given
	indentation is used if present, and \n[DI] otherwise.
	* doc/ms.ms (Displays and keeps): Add optional variable "indent"
	argument to syntax summary of ".ID".  Switch fonts more
	carefully and apply italic corrections.
	* tmac/groff_ms.7.man (Displays and keeps): Sync with doc/ms.ms.

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac: Properly situate devtag flag-related register
	names in the package name space.  Rename `need_eo_h` to
	`s@devtag-needs-end-of-heading'.  Rename `need_eo_tl` to
	`s@devtag-needs-end-of-title`.
	((initialization), par@reset, @SH, par@finish, @NH): Do it.
	(par@reset): Test their values more idiomatically.

	Fixes last third of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42515>.

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac-u (@h): Migrate SCCS revision 2.37 to be idiomatic
	for groff (and not throw warnings of type 'mac').

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/doc.am: Improve diagnostics during documentation
	generation; none should occur normally, but when they do, seeing
	troff complain about "<standard input>" is disheartening.
	(DOC_GROFF_ONLY): Add -b option so we get backtraces (also kill
	off trailing whitespace).
	(DOC_GROFF):
	(doc/pic.html):
	(doc/webpage.html): Add sed expression to inject `lf` request
	into the stream to identify the file being processed.

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/me-revisions: Supplement history with subsequent BSD work
	from versions 2.29 (1988-04-22) to 8.1 (1993-06-05).

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/me-revisions: Add 'me' macro package revision log, scraped
	from <https://svnweb.freebsd.org/csrg/share/me/revisions>.
	* doc/doc.am (DOCFILES): Ship it.

2021-06-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac-u: Rename registers for clarity.  Unlike other
	macro packages supplied by groff, "me" mostly remains within the
	AT&T 2-character name space, accessing extended names
	selectively through `do` and `de1` requests.  The package
	therefore has no characteristic name prefix.
	  need_eo_h  -> devtag-needs-end-of-heading
	  need_eo_tl -> devtag-needs-end-of-title
	  need_tl    -> devtag-needs-title
	(@html_check_need_title, sh, EQ): The foregoing registers are
	effectively Booleans, so perform Boolean-style tests on their
	interpolations.

	Fixes a second third of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42515>.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/e.tmac-u: Work in compatibility mode.  It seems this was
	the intention (reasonable, since "me" originates in pre-groff
	BSD Unix), but there were several problems.
	(@R): Prefix register existence test with `do`.
	(@html_check_need_title): Define with `do` since the macro name
	is long, and also with `de1` so that we can freely use groff
	extensions within.  Drop many `do` requests from macro
	definition.
	(@check_need_title): Define with `do`, as above.  Add comment
	explaining why `de1` is not needed for this macro definition.
	(@S): Prefix macro/string existence test with `do`.  Remove
	spurious space so that the argument string name is truly defined
	as empty.
	(nm, n1, n2): Prefix handling of long register names `_#p` and
	`_#f` with `do` request.
	(top level): Prefix `mso` request with `do`.
	((x-html): Define with `do` and `de1` instead of `de`.  Drop
	now-unnecessary `do` requests from macro body.
	()x-html): Define with `do` and `de1` instead of `de` for
	symmetry.
	(xp-html): Define with `do` and `de1` instead of `de`.  Drop
	now-unnecessary `do` requests from macro body.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60785>.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/devtag.tmac: Work in compatibility mode; define macros
	with the `de1` instead of the `de` request.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/refer-me.tmac:

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Properly situate devtag flag-related
	register names in the package name space.  Rename `need_eo_h` to
	`an-devtag-needs-end-of-heading'.  Rename `need_col2` to
	`an-devtag-needs-second-column`.
	(an-input-trap, SH, SS, HP, (initialization)): Do it.
	(an-input-trap): Test their values more idiomatically.

	Fixes one third of <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42515>.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (do_if_request): Improve diagnostic
	message; say "conditional operator", not just "conditional".

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-end, an-header): In continuous rendering
	mode, use same spacing amount after header and before footer as
	mdoc in its own continuous rendering mode.  Thanks to Ingo
	Schwarze for the suggestion.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60653>.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (P): Define this as the "canonical"
	paragraphing macro.
	(LP, PP): Make these aliases of P.

2021-06-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (spring_trap): Tighten lexical
	discipline; describe macro as "trap-called" rather than
	"trap-invoked".

2021-06-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Don't spuriously break a page after a paragraph tag when
	the tag is short enough to fit within the paragraph's
	indentation.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-write-paragraph-tag): Reserve ("need") 2
	vees plus 1 basic unit of vertical space regardless of the width
	of the tag.  In the short tag case, we reverse space by one vee
	after outputting the diversion in which the tag is stored, but
	it will always contain a break, and by the time we reverse, we
	might have already hit a page location trap
	{an-break-body-text}, and by then it's too late to back up.

	* tmac/tests/an-old_no-break-after-short-paragraph-tags.sh: Test

	Indent an IP paragraph based on the type size of the paragraph
	text, not a preceding heading.  We have to delay evaluating IP's
	argument until the font size has been reset, which I've
	attempted to do by simply passing the argument unevaluated down
	the call hierarchy, instead of saving it in a number register
	right away, as appears customary in this ms implementation.

	However, par@reset is called from a great number of places, and
	these usually set the indent registers beforehand.  I've left
	this as it is, so now two ways of setting the indents exist: via
	register and optionally via argument.

	* tmac/s.tmac (par@reset): Move font-size setting stuff before
	indent-setting stuff; set registers from optional arguments with
	default "n" scaling indicator before setting indents.
	(par*start, par@finish): Don't set registers, but instead pass
	arguments to par@reset.
	(@IP): Pass argument unevaluated to par*start.

	Refactor grog even more aggressively.  Make the tedious search
	for subs.pl unnecessary by inlining it into grog.pl directly.
	This makes the script stand alone and much more convenient to
	work with, and doesn't contribute to bloat, in my
	opinion--subs.pl was 10 times the size of grog.pl, and most of
	the code in the latter was dedicated to trying to locate
	subs.pl.

	* Makefile.am: Delete references to $(grog_dir).
	* configure.ac: Delete call of `GROFF_GROGDIR_DEFAULT` macro.
	* m4/groff.m4: Delete definition of same.
	* src/roff/grog/grog.am (GROG, dist_grog_DATA, grogdir): Drop

	* src/roff/groff/groff.cpp: Revise usage message.
	(synopsis): Set primary synopsis on a single output line, for
	convenience of parsing and also because we have no control over
	the width of the program name in character cells; it comes from
	argv[0] and is under user control.  There is thus no point in
	trying to get pretty formatting.  Also include separate synopsis
	lines for short and long help options.  Use opposite case from
	option flags for option arguments.
	(help): Collate option flags in English lexicographic order.
	Include space after flag letters for options that take
	arguments.  Consistently use capitals for option arguments
	because they are space-separated here.  Illustrate longer forms
	of -d and -r options.  Update language (some, like "tmac.name",
	was very old).  Add reference to groff(1) man page at end.
	(usage): Drop appendnment of notice regarding -h option; this is
	now covered in `synopsis()` unconditionally.

	"ls(1)", if it is too wide to fit in the page header (and would
	overwrite the center header material, usually the title of the
	manual section).  Since the beginning and end of the title might
	be important for disambiguation, truncation at either end would
	be unwise; replace the middle of the title with an ellipsis.
	Define new an-pageref and an-title-abbv strings for use by other
	macros and user-defined PT and BT traps.
	(PT, an-footer): Use new an-pageref string for economy.

2021-05-22  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/groff_www.7.man: Stop using the "www" macro package.  The
	macros it exposes are not part of the quasi-standardized man(7)
	language, and thus should not be used in man(7) documents.  See
	groff_man_style(7) for portability advice.  Besides, the
	extension macros in the permissively-licensed an-ext.tmac are
	sufficient to support URL and email hyperlinks, and our SH and
	SS macro implementations already support anchor placement
	without requiring explicit effort from page authors.
	(initialization): Stop sourcing www.tmac.  Stop calling .LK and
	.HR; the page-internal navigation links were being placed after
	the apropos line instead of at the beginning of the page,
	contradicting the comment that was there (possibly a bug).
	(Requests) <URL, LK>: Stop calling .TAG.

	* doc/groff.texi (Comments): Fix error in description of parser
	operation; '.\"' is an effective whole-line comment not because
	it is a call of an undefined macro named '\"' (no 'mac' warning

	comment escape is recognized normally and what remains is
	handled as the empty request.  Clarify that the optional
	argument to the .ig request is the name of a macro (which will
	be called normally _and_ end the ignored region; this is
	analogous to ".de foo bar").

	[man]: Slightly refactor footer spacing management when

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-end): Increase the page length _after_
	flushing a pending output line.  Do so only by the amount of
	spacing we actually perform next.  Make the scaling indicator on
	the .sp request explicit.  The amount seemed magical because it
	was accounting for the one line to be consumed by output of the

	same amount _after_ flushing a pending output line, for symmetry
	with other spacing requests (and to prevent nasty surprises
	analogous to those in Savannah #60611).
	(doc-header): Put 3 vees of space after the header in continuous

	[man]: Fix stochastic vertical space loss problems in continuous
	rendering mode by being more scrupulous about extending the page
	length.  As noted in Savannah #60611, sometimes the vertical
	space between a header line and the first section heading
	{"Name"} would be reduced or removed altogether, in a way that
	was highly sensitive to circumstances.  As far as I can tell,
	the problem is that this vertical space disappeared only when we
	were in double-secret probation no-space mode; this is the
	special non-spacing mode {not apparent with inspection of
	\n[.ns]} that happens when the stealth internal page location
	trap is sprung.  This trap does not appear in .ptr output but
	can be disabled with ".vpt 0", which is an alternative fix for
	this problem {because continuous rendering mode does not use
	vertical position traps at all}.  Another fix might have been to
	simply call the moral equivalent of ".pl MAXINT" as soon as
	continuous rendering mode was decided upon.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-header): In continuous rendering mode,
	extend the page length by one line before calling PT to output
	the page header, and afterwards, extend the page length by 3
	vees and space by that amount (instead of half an inch).

	* tmac/tests/an-old_X-register-works.sh: Rewrite.  Increase test
	coverage and stop assuming that -rcR=1 and -rX=anything is a

	suppress the printing of page numbers anyway.)

2021-05-19  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (initialization): Refactor handling of P and
	X rendering parameter register validation in preparation for

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Rename many package macros, strings, and
	registers (and the lone named environment) to be more expressive
	of their function.  "an-footer" is now the proper complement of
	"an-header" (setting up an environment and calling a
	user-redefinable trap macro).

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Rearrange alternating font macros to be in
	alphabetical order (and the order documented in groff_man(7).

2021-05-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Refactor alternating font macros.  These
	macros are hard enough to understand without adding gratuitous
	structural differences to the reader's burden.  Make their
	implementations rigidly parallel.  Update comments.
	(RI, IR, IB, BI, RB, BR): Always define the `an-result` string
	as empty except for a non-printing input break for the sake of
	compatibility mode.
	(RI, IR, IB, BI): Defer interpolation of the first argument to
	the while loop if there are at least two (like the existing RB,
	BR).  This way the style name arguments to the font selection
	escape sequences in the appendment to `an-result` match the
	order of the letters in the macro name (useful to make sense of
	diffs).
	(RI, IR, IB, BI, RB, BR): Always remove the `an-result` string
	after interpolating it.
	(RB, BR): Only do work if there are any arguments.

2021-05-18  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Apply italic corrections more consistently.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (BI, IB, IR, RI): Apply italic corrections
	more consistently.  Add lengthy comment rationalizing approach.
	(RI, BI): An italic correction is now applied after the last
	argument if it is of even parity (i.e., the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ...).

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Description/Font style macros): Note
	that italic corrections are applied.

	[man]: Ignore FT register when appropriate.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (initialization): Validate user-specified
	value of \n[FT].  Continuous rendering ignores FT (page location
	traps are not used for footers in that mode).  Measuring a
	footer distance from the page top isn't done.  A footer distance
	of over half the page length is unlikely.  A footer distance of
	less than one line height is too.  Issue diagnostics in all of
	these cases.

	* tmac/tests/tmac/tests/\
	an-old_FT-bad-value-should-not-trash-titles.sh: Test it.

2021-05-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (TH): Plant the an-footer trap (where we
	schedule a break in the page text prior to spacing down to the
	footer) at twice the value of \n[FT], not a hard-coded -1i.
	This way, the user can't make the an-p-footer trap (planted at
	\n[FT]) spring before the an-footer trap that should precede it.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Options) <-rFT>: Document this.

	troff (and groff) special character \(lh; see
	<https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=703187>.  Store

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_HTML_PROGRAMS, GROFF_PDFDOC_PROGRAMS):

	missing to be more mutually congruent.
	(GROFF_URW_FONTS_CHECK): Tweak to note that gs is only run to
	locate the URW fonts if gs is available.

	* tmac/tests/an-old_AT-and-UC-footer-saved-and-restored.sh:
	Tweak to be more helpful when troubleshooting exasperating
	header/footer problems as in Savannah #60609.

2021-05-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	[man]: Fix missing page footers when continuously rendering
	multiple documents.  Resolving this uncovered entangled header
	and footer management bugs with batch processing even when _not_
	continuously rendering.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (an-start-new-document): New macro clears
	header trap so it doesn't get called with stale information.
	{The TH macro already replants a header trap with every man
	page if not continuously rendering.}  This macro also absorbs
	the break-page and page number incrementation logic from TH.
	(TH): Adapt semantics of "an-first" register to mean not "first
	page rendered" (apparently) but "first page of new document".
	If we are _not_ on the first page of a new document and the TH
	macro is called, we must be batch processing: force the previous
	man page to end (call an-end if continuously rendering, or
	an-start-new-document if not).  After all the header and footer
	strings have been configured for the man page, call an-header if
	we're on the first page of the document, not (just) if we're
	continuously rendering.  Zero an-first register at end of macro
	here unconditionally instead of conditionally in .an-header.
	(an-header): Drop conditional on continuous rendering.

	When I batch-render our 62 man pages to the terminal, I do note
	one cosmetic regression: the lj4_font(5) page, when continuously
	rendered in batch processing, has no space between its header
	line and first section heading ("Name").  Another cosmetic issue
	in this scenario is that the footers for every rendered page but
	the last, which had (wrongly) been absent entirely, are set with
	no space after them and the header of the next.

	* tmac/tests/an-old_page-footers-present.sh:
	* tmac/tests/an-old_page-header-has-current-data.sh: Add man
	page header/footer regression tests.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run the tests.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60609>.

2021-05-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (initialization): Key the reprocessing guard
	{like a C language #include guard} on the existence of the TH
	macro instead of RI.  The latter seemed kind of random and TH
	is even more guaranteed to exist; it is the macro name most
	characteristic of the man(7) language and the andoc.tmac
	superstructure relies on it.  (TH may have been avoided because
	of its use with tbl(1); however, neither man(7) nor mdoc(7)
	support tbl's TH feature, and GNU tbl does not supply its own
	empty fallback definition as it does for TS and TE.  If we ever
	want TH-like functionality in future man pages, I suggest we
	pick a new, non-colliding name for it.)
	(initialization): Relocate load of devtag package; we don't
	need it before entering compatibility mode.  Move assignment of
	format of an-page-letter register from a "loose declaration"
	amid macro definitions to within existence test of X register.
	Stop initializing an-extra[123] strings outside of any macro;
	they need to be reinitialized at every TH call when batch
	rendering.
	(TH): Call DT in a less surprising place.
	(TH): Initialize all header/footer-related strings before
	calling header macros, even those not needed for the default
	header configuration.
	(TH): Add style warnings for underspecified arguments.
	(an-ne): Rename register from "an-need", which is pretty
	confusing in context, to "an-amount", since (1) a (vertical)
	amount is what it is, and (2) it's only used within this macro.
	Also due to factor (2), remove the register after using it.

2021-05-15  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_URW_FONTS): Update configure script check
	for URW fonts to recognize recent releases of the URW Base 35
	fonts from Artifex Software.  Look for the AR (Arial roman
	equivalent) font under all of the names recognized by
	fonts/devpdf/Foundry.in.
	* m4/groff.m4 (GROFF_URW_FONTS_CHECK): Update wording of notice
	when URW fonts are not found.  Replace dead URL with working
	one.  Try to hedge against the future, but the Web is an
	ephemeral place, as are the file names Artifex gives to its
	fonts.  Thanks to T. Kurt Bond and Thomas Dupond for reporting
	and investigating the problem.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (SS): Add devtags support.  Set a subsection
	title as a second-level heading and add it to a table of
	contents, if any.  Prompted by a query from Hans Unzner to the
	groff mailing list.  Thanks, Hans!

2021-04-17  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (SH): Fix apparent thinko.  Pass the devtags
	macro a literal "1" argument.  Passing it \n[an-level] wasn't
	correct (it stores the relative inset level, not a sectioning
	level), and was useless anyway: SH has already called
	.an-set-margin by this point, which resets \n[an-level] to 1.
	man(7) does not support nesting of SH macros.  Also call
	.DEVTAG-NH by its alias .DEVTAG-SH since section headings are
	not numbered in man(7).

	ASCII.
	* tmac/fr.tmac: Tell Vim file is "iso-8859-15" (ISO Latin-9).

	Vim users may need to use ":e ++enc=iso-8859-2", for instance,
	to see correct glyphs.

	The first-order determinant of hyphenation points is language,
	not territory.  Use ISO 639 2-letter language codes for
	hyphenation and exception patterns instead of ISO 3166 2-letter
	territory codes.

	* tmac/*.us: Rename *.us files to *.en.
	* tmac/troffrc: Change hyphenation language "us" to "en".
	* tmac/en.tmac: Add English localization file.  Set hyphenation
	mode to 4.

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Hyphenation):
	* man/groff.7.man (Hyphenation):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Implementation differences): Refer to
	"U.S. English" hyphenation patterns as simply "English"; they
	will be mostly correct for Commonwealth English as well, and no
	alternative English hyphenation patterns for other territories
	are available.

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Hyphenation):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (New requests): Note that default
	hyphenation mode depends on the language used on the system.
	Add concept index entry for localization.  Add file index
	entries for the locale macro files (cs.tmac, etc.).  Update to
	reflect rename of English hyphenation patterns and .hla
	identifier from "us" to "en".

2021-04-09  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Implement new .soquiet and .msoquiet requests.

	Needed for two planned developments: {1} the i18n patch in
	Savannah #59814 can use this to quietly attempt to open a
	localization file.  groff only supports a few locales, so people
	with LANG=es_ES, for instance, would ordinarily see warning
	diagnostics on every groff startup; and {2} system- or
	site-configurable support of per-user {.,}troffrc or man.local
	files, gracefully failing if they don't exist.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp:
	(do_source): Add new function, taking boolean "quietly"
	parameter and absorbing function of source(), with added
	conditional.
	(source): Convert into a wrapper to call do_source() unquietly.
	(source_quietly): Wrap do_source(), quietly.
	(do_macro_source, macro_source, macro_source_quietly): Analogous
	to the foregoing.
	(init_requests): Hook "msoquiet" to macro_source_quietly() and
	"soquiet" to "source_quietly().

	* doc/groff.texi (I/O):
	* man/groff.7.man (Requests/Request short reference):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Language/New requests): Document them.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/msoquiet_works.sh:
	* src/roff/groff/tests/soquiet_works.sh: Test them.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Add tests.

2021-04-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (ms Document Control Settings) <FF>: Update
	description to cover application of footnote format to footnote
	markers in general, not just numbers.  Clarify different
	behavior of format 1 with respect to automatic numbers and other
	markers.
	(ms Footnotes) <*>: Describe string operation in more detail.
	<FS>: Describe more precisely how the optional argument is
	handled.

	* doc/ms.ms (Footnotes): Synchronize with doc/groff.texi.  Add
	example using document's own text as a model.

	* tmac/groff_ms.7.man (Usage/Footnotes): Resync relevant
	portions with doc/ms.ms.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60227>.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.1.man: Document new -k and -K options.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60349>.

2021-04-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Hyphenation):
	Recast introductory paragraph to better distinguish the
	automatic breaking of words and placement of hyphens at
	user-specified hyphenation points (done with the \% escape) and
	automatic determination of hyphenation points within words (what
	the pattern files and most of the hyphenation mode parameters
	are for).  Clarify that what our manual calls "automatic
	hyphenation" pertains only to the latter.
	<hw> Correct over-general claim; hyphenation exceptions defined
	with the .hw request _do_ honor .hy value 2 (don't break a word
	at the bottom of a page), but none of the others.
	<\%> Recast description of escape to emphasize independence of
	its two uses (e.g., "\%pseudo\%unununium" is hyphenated only
	after "pseudo-", if at all).
	<\:> Clarify that escape is an input word boundary.
	<shc> Clarify that the soft hyphen glyph is applied to manual as
	well as automatically-determined hyphenation points.
	<hy> Recharacterize as setting the _automatic_ hyphenation mode.
	Note that restrictions apart from value 2 are not applied to
	words with manually-assigned hyphenation points.
	<nh> Note that request affects only automatic hyphenation.

	* man/groff.7.man (Requests/Request short reference) <.hy,.nh>:
	Clarify that requests deal with _automatic_ hyphenation.
	(Registers/Read-only registers) <.hy>:
	Clarify that register applies to _automatic_ hyphenation.
	(Hyphenation): Add new introductory paragraph summarizing manual
	hyphenation support and features, including notice that breaking
	at explicit hyphens is performed in fill mode, i.e., even if
	_automatic_ hyphenation is disabled.

	Thanks to Peter Schaffter for the report.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?60332>.

2021-03-27  Deri James  <deri@chuzzlewit.myzen.co.uk>

	Italic rather than Oblique.

2021-03-24  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Filling and Adjustment):
	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Language/Extended requests): Fix
	incorrect claim that additional inter-sentence space is applied
	only in fill mode.  Drop word "parameter" from description of
	unit used in .ss request arguments; it is a needlessly specific
	reference to the font file format.  Tighten wording.

	* man/groff.7.man (Control Characters): Fix incorrect claim that
	end-of-sentence detection is attempted only in fill mode.  Note
	that .ss request also affects inter-word spacing.

	* man/groff_diff.7.man (Language/Extended requests):
	  - Drop example.
	  - Move discussion of AT&T vs. GNU troff difference in .ss
	    handling from here...
	  (Implementation Differences): ...to here.

	Thanks to Dave Kemper for his continued scrutiny!

2021-03-01  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac: Improve diagnostic messages.
	(@diag): New macro wraps .tm request, always prefixing it with
	the name of the macro package, as well as file and line
	indicators only if these are set to non-empty or non-zero
	values, respectively.
	(@error, @warning): Call @diag instead of .tm directly.
	(@fatal): Retire; it had only one call site and it would have
	greatly complicated @diag to support calling .ab instead of .tm.
	An ugly alternative would have been to call .ab with a redundant
	message after calling @diag.
	(@divert): New macro wraps .di request, remembering the name of
	the current file (\n[.F]) when a diversion is started.
	(@error-recover): Call .ab instead of (deleted) @fatal.
	(pg@super-eject): Tell user what the last file name seen was
	when recovering from an unfinished diversion when processing
	ends.

	Fixes <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55099>.

2021-02-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Fix bug where having line numbering off but the output line
	number register \n[ln] set to a positive value would cause
	tbl(1) table rows to spontaneously become numbered.  Use new
	\n[.nm] register to determine whether line numbering is enabled.

	* src/preproc/tbl/table.cpp (table::init_output, table::do_row,
	table::do_bottom): Predicate all conditions on \n[ln]
	additionally on \n[.nm].

	Thanks to Olle Lögdahl for the report.  Problem appears to date
	back to commit b69062693d3360efce9d4d63fac337be21e07db7, 20 July

2021-02-25  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Implement new read-only register ".nm".  It reports the
	enablement status of output line numbering (caused by the .nm
	request) irrespective of the temporary suspension of numbering
	with the .nn request.  Needed because there was no way to
	introspect its state, tbl(1) needs to do so, and the writable
	line number register \n[ln] is not a reliable proxy for it.

	* src/roff/troff/env.h: Add get_numbering_nodes(), returning

	(KF): ...similarly for kp@fdiv.
	(generally): Update diversion dereference sites and derived

	* src/libs/libgroff/searchpath.cpp (search_path::open_file,
	search_path::open_file_cautious): Save errno before calling
	free() and restore it afterwards.  A future version of POSIX
	will require that free() not change errno if it succeeds[1];
	some C library implementations, including recent versions of
	glibc[2], lack this property.  free() is called in these
	libgroff functions to clean up after an unsuccessful fopen() of
	a heap-allocated file name string, and because the errno from
	fopen() may be passed to strerror() in a diagnostic message, it
	needs to be accurate.  I checked the rest of groff's codebase
	and found no other instances of free() being used to clean up
	after fopen() failure.

	more carefully to keep it from being incorrectly parsed as a
	decrement, because negative values of \n[.hlm] are valid (in
	fact, "-1" is the default).  In documents with a large number of
	tables, this can lead to a Persian chessboard problem and an
	integer overflow (at the groff language level, caught and
	handled by src/roff/troff/number.cpp:parse_term()).

	It is wise to wrap a non-literal second argument to the .nr
	request in parentheses if assignment is desired and its value
	can be negative.  See section 5.6.1 ("Setting Registers") of the

	[tbl]: Save and restore hyphenation parameters.

	a table, save the hyphenation parameters (\n[.hy], \n[.hla],
	\n[.hlm], \n[.hym], \n[.hys]).  Restore them in the table reset
	macro (confusingly called "3init"), which is called before
	performing each diversion and before exiting a table.

	This enables people to, e.g., turn off hyphenation in a table
	text block with .nh, just as they can turn off adjustment with
	.na, without having to manually reset it.  The next text block,

	* tmac/troffrc:
	* tmac/troffrc-end:
	  - Identify files in header comments as part of GNU troff.

	* tmac/troffrc:
	  - Clarify purpose of .do request.
	  - Identify .X (set by groff -X) as a register, not a string.
	  - Remove temporary registers one per line to make
	    synchronization with foregoing logic easier.  Fixes name
	    space management nits: an undefined string troffrc!Xps was
	    being removed, and troffrc!{ascii,latin1,utf8,cp1047} were
	    not being removed despite being defined.

	* tmac/troffrc-end:
	  - Clarify that file is read after -m file arguments (not "all
	    macro sets", which can be loaded with .mso after this file
	    is processed).
	  - Advise usage of .do for groff extensions.
	  - Line-break one-off conditionals as troffrc does.
	  - Add empty string comment to empty string definitions.

	Commit 87edb525, from 2003, added character U+2026 (HORIZONTAL
	ELLIPSIS) to most base groff fonts, but there has been no
	kerning information for this character.  To produce consistent
	typography, it should be kerned the same way as the period,
	which is in 818 kern pairs across all the devps fonts.

	Apply the following shell command to the groff description files
	of the PostScript fonts.

	  for file in font/devps/*[A-Z]

	`curr_prefix` by calling searchpathext() from here...

	* contrib/glilypond/glilypond.pl:
	* contrib/gperl/gperl.pl:
	* contrib/gpinyin/gpinyin.pl:
	* tmac/hyphenex.pl: Avoid Perl's unsafe "<>" operator.

	The "<>" operator is implemented using the two-argument form of
	"open", which interprets magic such as pipe characters, allowing
	execution of arbitrary commands which is unlikely to be
	expected.  Perl >= 5.22 has a "<<>>" operator which avoids this,
	but also forbids the use of "-" to mean the standard input,
	which is a facility that the affected groff programs document.

	ARGV::readonly would probably also fix this, but I fundamentally
	dislike the approach of escaping data in preparation for a
	language facility to unescape it, especially when the required
	escaping is as non-obvious as it is here.  (For the same reason,
	I prefer to use subprocess invocation facilities that allow
	passing the argument list as a list rather than as a string to
	be interpreted by the shell.)  So I've abandoned this dubious
	convenience and changed the affected programs to iterate over
	command-line arguments manually using the three-argument form of
	open.

	glilypond doesn't need the initial unshift since that's already
	handled in contrib/glilypond/args.pl.

	Document use of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and TZ.

	The semantics of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to groff were not established
	with respect to time zone selection, prompting divergent
	interpretations; Debian and distributions derived from it have
	for several years patched groff to implicitly use UTC as the
	time zone when interpreting the current time (or
	SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH) as a local time.  While a convenient and
	defensible choice for reproducible build efforts[1], it runs
	against the grain of user expectations.  Systems programmers
	like monotonically increasing clocks; the broader user base
	usually prefers a clock that follows an applicable civil
	calendar.  To the latter audience, a difference between
	  $ date "+%Y-%M-%d %H:%m:%S"
	and
	  $ groff <<EOF
	  .af year 0000
	  .af mo 00
	  .af dy 00
	  .af hours 00
	  .af minutes 00
	  .af seconds 00
	  .tm \n[year]-\n[mo]-\n[dy] \n[hours]:\n[minutes]:\n[seconds]
	  EOF
	is difficult to explain.

	time components in registers; the grohtml, gropdf, and grops
	output drivers write the information to the output in comments.

	[ms]: Set footnote line length to AT&T default.

	groff ms has since its initial implementation used a default
	footnote line length of 5/6ths of the text line length; this may
	correspond to an early AT&T ms default (perhaps documented in
	the 1974 version of the M. E. Lesk paper, "Typing Documents on
	the UNIX System"[1]).  However, as early as V6 Unix (1975), AT&T
	ms actually used a footnote line length of 11/12ths of the text
	line length instead[2].

	Heirloom Doctools and neatroff ms also use this default.

	* tmac/s.tmac: Implement \*< and \*> strings for subscripting.
	groff ms has had (extension) strings for superscripting since
	1991 at the latest, and the asymmetry possessed me of a madness.
	Both pairs of string names follow similar usage in Eric Allman's
	"me" macros.

	* tmac/groff_mdoc.7.man (Predefined strings): Fix error: the
	\*[Lq] and \*[Rq] strings degrade to neutral double quotes (")

	* tmac/s.tmac (ds*end!0): Improve diagnostic to mention .RD.

2020-10-30  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/s.tmac: Revise diagnostic messages.  Define a common
	prefix string, starting all such messages with "s.tmac".
	Continues the long process of fixing Savannah #52463.  Drop the
	word "macro" from diagnostic since this will now be clear from
	the prefix.  Prefix every macro name in a diagnostic message
	with a leading dot; this was already done in four cases.
	(cov*first-page-init): Use temporary string to avoid multi-line
	diagnostic message.
	(@NH): Use temporary string to prevent overlength line.

	A further benefit of this revision is that index information
	produced by ms's .IX macro (which writes to the standard error
	stream) will now be trivially easy to extract even for documents
	that cause diagnostic messages.  One can simply filter them with
		grep -v '^s\.tmac:'
	or similar.

	Fix ms .TC macro by allowing it to actually use lowercase Roman
	numerals for the page(s) of the table of contents when a custom
	title (header or footer) is defined containing '%'.

	As a side effect, eliminate the PN register, which was
	apparently misused because it was undocumented and had a name
	just long enough to be both suggestive and ambiguous.  Another
	pin goes into my Ken Thompson voodoo doll.

	* tmac/s.tmac (IX): Write out page number of index term(s) using
	the % register (instead of PN), obtaining whatever format is
	assigned to the register at that time.
	(CH): Similarly, output %, not PN, in the center of the default
	heading.
	(PT): Save the format of %, set it to decimal, copy its value to
	a new register, pg*page-number-in-decimal, then restore %'s
	previous format.  Compare the new register, not %, to 1 to
	determine whether special page one behavior should be used.
	(pg*end-page): Assign pg*next-format to %, not PN.
	(XA): Define toc*num with the interpolation of %, not PN.

	* tmac/tests/s_TC-works-with-percent-in-custom-titles.sh: Test.
	* tmac/tmac.am (tmac_TESTS): Run test.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Add fallback for lq, rq strings.

	Define \*(lq and \*(rq as '"' if the output device has no \(lq
	or \(rq special character escapes defined (respectively).

	This is a bit belt-and-suspenders for groff since our output
	devices all guarantee availability of these glyphs, but if this
	macro file gets used with other implementations (and if they
	support the 'c' conditional), it should prevent the strings from
	producing empty output.

	Man page writers should simply use \(lq and \(rq unless they are
	aiming for pathological levels of portability (e.g., composing
	man pages today for consumption on simulators of 1980s Unix
	systems).

	* src/preproc/tbl/main.cpp (main): Stop ignoring -T.  GNU tbl

	implemented it, something on the system called tbl with that

	Clark with bug reports.  We can probably weather the volume of
	such spurious reports from IRIX users today.

	macro written to the output, reword the warning diagnostic that
	is emitted when a table row is to be output without enough room
	before the next page location trap.  The former wording said
	that a "text block" would not fit on the page, and that is
	normally how table rows grow longer than one line in the first
	place.  However, there are other ways the conditional can be
	satisfied, as witnessed in Savannah #57665, so simply say what
	is known; that the table _row_ overruns the space to the next
	trap (we say the row won't "fit on [the] page").

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Drop \*[an-empty] string.  This string is
	documented as preventing "looping" (presumably infinitely) if
	someone calls a two-font macro with an inconvenient parameter;
	the example shown is ".RB ( \\ )".  This string was being
	interpolated at the end of each argument pair to the two-font
	macros BI, BR, IB, RB, and RI.  This code dates back to groff
	1.10 (dc5351364982f78f8c630f1e856d692d4a82666f, 26 November
	1995).  Did you notice a two-font macro missing?  It was: IR.
	Using it with the proscribed input fails to cause a problem; the
	others similarly operate just fine when the empty string
	interpolation is removed.  Presumably at some point in the past
	25 years, this workaround became unnecessary.
	(BI, BR, IB, RB, RI): Remove interpolations of string.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Refactor continuous rendering handling.
	Relocate set up of \n[cR] to end of file in parallel with other
	rendering parameter management.  Instead of conditionally
	defining the an-ne and an-bp macros, define them
	unconditionally.  Also define them with .de instead of .de1,
	since they will only be called within the contexts of macros
	that are already running with compatibility mode off (i.e., the
	public interface macros).  Relocate definition of an-end to sit
	alongside these other continuous-rendering-mode specific macros
	and avoid a forward reference and scattering of \n[cR]
	conditionals around the file.
	(an-set-up-continuous-rendering): Define new macro to move
	macros (and end macro) into place.  Call it at the end of the
	file only if cR eventually winds up being true.

2020-09-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Improve name space management.  Rename .ne

	parallel with .an-bp).  Rename 'an-ne' register to 'an-need' to
	prevent confusion with renamed request.

2020-09-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Drop .ll hack for LL register.

	Drop the .ll hack for setting the line length on nroff devices.

	Once upon a time, the only way to get man pages to render on a
	terminal at any width other than the nroff default of 65n was to
	put an .ll request into the page--a mortal sin against
	portability--or your man(1) program could sneak such a request
	into nroff's input stream.

	Also, long ago, John Eaton of UT Austin wrote a man(1) program.
	In a few years this implementation branched into two lines of
	development, which I'll call man-db man (Wilford/Polacco/Watson)
	and another, Brouwer/Lucifredi man, which as of this writing saw
	its last release in 2011 (1.6g).

	The man and mdoc macros of groff 1.18 (July 2002) introduced an
	LL register to configure the line length, respecting an -rLL
	command-line option.  The source change was made by Werner
	Lemberg on 3 May 2002 and Colin Watson updated man-db man(1)--on
	the same day!--to synthesize the option when calling groff.

	Later, in August 2005, Keith Marshall, a user of vesion 1.5m of
	Brouwer/Lucifredi man(1), which did not set the LL register,
	suggested that the existing .ll setting (technically, the value
	of \n[.l], the only way the result of an .ll request could be
	introspected) be honored in the absence of the LL register.
	However, it is impossible to distinguish a user-supplied ".ll
	65n" request from nroff's default setting, which was in that
	case overridden to the modern default of 78n.

	And so, in what is now git commit
	f9d5df4aebd3d834b4084ffefa52a115e00dce38 (1 September 2005), it
	was done.

	This led to (1) surprising behavior for users accustomed to old
	methods and desirous of the nroff default and (2) lengthy
	apologia in groff source code comments and the groff_man(7) man
	page.

	Ironically, Brouwer/Lucifredi man(1) had already added support
	for the LL register by the time of its 1.6 release two months
	earlier (20 June 2005).  (Curiously, it did so similarly to the
	old .ll hack, by injecting an '.nr LL' request into groff's
	input stream, rather than using the -r command-line option.)
	Moreover, Marshall and the groff list were already aware of
	this, but the change was accepted anyway because version 1.6
	was "too new"!  (Distributions are slow sometimes, true...)

	Let us survey the field in 2020.  man-db man(1) has supported
	the LL register for eighteen years, and Brouwer/Lucifredi man(1)
	for fifteen.  Heirloom Doctools's man macros set the line length
	to 78n on nroff devices unconditionally.  mandoc(1) similarly
	also always formats for 78 columns on terminals.  groff's
	mdoc(7) macros grew support for LL in parallel with man(7) in
	2002 and never added the \n[.l] introspection at all.

	There no longer seems to be any reason to preserve this hack.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac (initialization): Drop complex setup of LL
	register.
	(TH): Relocate line length reset; no behavior change.
	(after .mso man.local): Initialize LL only if the user hasn't;
	use device default in troff mode, and 78n in nroff mode.

	* tmac/groff_man.7.man.in (Options) <-rLL>: Stop documenting .ll
	hack.

2020-09-03  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* makevarescape.sed: Use \[] form of special character escapes.

	The only man page we have that doesn't turn compatibility mode
	off (neqn) also doesn't use any sed-substituted patterns where
	characters replaced by a \[] special character escape form are
	likely to be used.

	The @g@ command prefix is the main avenue for intrusion of such
	escapes, but I think it improbable that many people are going to
	include apostrophes, double quotes, carets, grave accents, or
	tildes in the command prefix; some or all of these will pick
	fights with the shell and require quoting that we don't
	represent in man page text anyway.

	On top of that, neqn is largely a stub page.

	If it's a problem, a better fix than reverting this is to make
	neqn switch out of compatibility mode like our other man pages.

	string interpolations.  The statement about a leading " in a
	string definition (or appendment with .as) was stated too
	generally.  The leading quote is not necessary to include
	leading tab characters, which can be input as-is, even in
	compatibility mode.

	Migrate macro packages from font CW to CR.  The font name "CW"
	{"constant-width"} is a legacy item we can dispose of (except
	for the DVI device, which also has CWI for "constant-width
	italic"), and much of the groff codebase already did starting
	with commit 0de1d6d79cdb959ffa7dac3af77c2a36ef31873f {October
	2017}.  Courier is available in the usual four styles {roman,
	bold, italic, bold+italic}.

	* tmac/an-ext.tmac (.EX): Set font to R, not CW.  The existing
	.ft request was somewhat redundant with the '.do fam C'
	immediately before, which set the font family to Courier.
	* tmac/s.tmac (.UC): Use font CR, not CW.

2020-07-23  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/tty.tmac: Stop suppressing nonexistent font warning.
	Prompted by a 2017 suggestion and patch from Bjarni Ingi
	Gislason.  Documents and macro packages that want to change the
	font family should do so in awareness that this is meaningless
	on terminal (nroff) devices (and -Thtml as well).

	* doc/groff.texi (Groff Options): Remove editorial comment about
	'-a' option being "useless".  It isn't.  Update example for

	Update documentation of .ss request.

	* doc/groff.texi (Manipulating Filling and Adjusting): Rewrite
	documentation of .ss request and \n[.ss] and \n[.sss] escapes.
	Note that negative values are not permitted in either argument
	to .ss.  Use new terminology, "minimal inter-word spacing" and
	"additional inter-sentence spacing" for clarity.  Clarify that
	additional inter-sentence spacing is only used when the output
	line is not full when the end of a sentence occurs.  Add index
	nodes to help readers find discussion of details of spacing
	between words and sentences.  Move discussion of differences
	from AT&T troff to section "Implementation Differences".  Update
	example to more closely resemble a real-world case, use second
	argument to .ss request, and eliminate hackish use of .nop
	request.

	* man/groff_diff.7.man (New number registers): Recast in
	parallel with the foregoing.

	* man/groff.7.man (Read-only registers): Use new terminology and
	describe \n[.ss] and \n[.sss] in meaningful terms, not by
	reference to arguments to the .ss request (which wasn't even

	Offer recommendations for those struggling with encoding
	detection.
	(Usage/Coding Tags): Stop manipulating line adjustment.  Use
	hyphen-minus (\- escape) characters in coding tag names, since

	* **/*.{man,tmac}: Save compatibility mode robustly.

	Use new \n[.cp] register to save compatibilty mode.

	Use register names based on the filename (at the source
	maintenance level) to avoid clobbering other files' saved
	compatibility modes.

	* tmac/html.tmac: Eliminate test of saved-compatibility
	register by moving its body inside the block where compatibility

2020-04-16  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Implement new read-only .cp register.

	Within a .do request, \n[.cp] holds the saved value of
	compatibility mode.

	The register \n[.cp] is specialized and may require a statement
	of rationale.  When writing macro packages or documents that use
	groff features and which may be mixed with other packages or
	documents that do not—common scenarios include serial processing
	of man pages or use of the .so or .mso requests—you may desire
	correct operation regardless of compatibility mode in the
	surrounding context.  It may occur to you to save the existing
	value of \n(.C into a register, say, _C, at the beginning of
	your file, turn compatibility mode off with “.cp 0”, then
	restore it from that register at the end with “.cp \n(_C”.  At
	the same time, a modular design of a document or macro package
	may lead you to multiple layers of inclusion.  You cannot use
	the same register name everywhere or you risk “clobbering” the
	value from a preceding or enclosing context.  The two‐character
	register namespace of AT&T troff is confining and mnemonically
	challenging; you may wish to use groff's more capacious
	namespace.  However, attempting “.nr _my_saved_C \n(.C” will not
	work in compatibility mode; the register name is too long.
	“This is exactly what .do is for,” you think, “.do nr
	_my_saved_C \n(.C”.  The foregoing will always save zero to your
	register, because .do turns compatibility mode off while it
	interprets its argument list.  What you need is:
		.do nr _my_saved_C \n[.cp]
		.cp 0
	at the beginning of your file, followed by
		.cp \n[_my_saved_C]
	at the end.  As in the C language, we all have to share one big
	namespace, so choose a register name that is unlikely to collide
	with other uses.

	It's too easy for the nroff version to get desynced from the
	groff version when we're running test cases, leading to spurious
	results.  Make it easier to see a discrepancy.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.sh: Call groff with -v or --version when
	we are called that way.  Let test cases tell us to use
	test-groff as groff with an environment variable.

	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose_option_works.sh.in: Rename to...
	* src/roff/nroff/tests/verbose_option_works.sh: ...this.  Check
	the nroff version being tested against the groff version being
	wrapped.  This exposes a bug; the system groff rather than the
	build tree groff was being invoked.  Refactor.  Stop messing
	with @GROFF_BIN_PATH_SETUP@ (enabling the rename); instead, let
	test-groff handle that for us.  Locate it and export the
	variable GROFF_TEST_GROFF so nroff can find it.  Because we
	manipulate $PATH to run the tests, the $PATH of an installed
	groff system will _always_ differ from that used by a build
	tree; ignore it in the test cases.  Dispose of bashisms and set
	shebang to /bin/sh.

	* src/roff/nroff/nroff.am: Stop generating the above test
	script.  It can now be run as it ships.

	Make our assert() C99-conformant.

	groff has its own implementation of the standard C library's
	assert() macro.  It hasn't been updated since C89.  C99 requires
	that the diagnostic emitted by assert() contain the failing
	expression and name of the function in scope.

	* src/include/assert.h: Add additional pointer to const char
	arguments to do_assert() and assertion_failed() for function
	name and stringified expression.
	(assertion_failed): Update prototype.
	(do_assert): Accept 'func' and 'msg' parameters and pass them to
	assertion_failed().
	(assert): Update macro to collect '__func__' and stringify the
	expr parameter (as 'msg') and pass them do do_assert().
	* src/libs/libgroff/assert.cpp (assertion_failed): Rewrite
	diagnostic to more closely match GNU Coding Style format and
	also report function and failing expression.

	Example output:
		troff: ../src/roff/troff/input.cpp:2644: do_request():
		assertion failed: '0 == "But first, here's a rotten old
		BBC programme."'

	We have no excuse to assert(0) ever again.  Express the

	Enable backtracing across process/file boundaries when errors or
	non-ignored warnings are encountered.

	Experimentation reveals that .so, .mso, and .pso requests acted
	as barriers to backtracing except when explicitly requested with
	the .backtrace request.  Judging by the git history, this
	behavior dates back to June 1991 or earlier.  The intention,
	according to a source comment, was only to suppress the
	backtrace output for the line corresponding to the outermost
	level of the input stack (commonly, a file argument to groff).
	Unfortunately, that wasn't its only effect.

	This change does result in one additional line of output for
	each error or (non-ignored) warning when -b is given.  However,
	I regard this as unobjectionable because {1} a backtrace was in
	fact explicitly requested; and {2} it seems a poor tradeoff to
	suppress most of the backtrace in some complicated and
	frustrating cases for the sake of one fewer line of backtrace
	output in a trivial one.

	Now, backtracing behaves the same no matter what triggers it.

	Fixes Savannah #58153.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (file_iterator::backtrace): Call
	get_location() for its side effect of rewriting a filename of
	"-" to "<standard input>", for consistency with other diagnostic
	messages.  (In this class, this member function always returns
	1, so ignore the return value.  This fact is an essential part
	of what led to the bug; the conditional
		p && !p->get_location(0, &f, &n)
	which appeared in the for loop of input_stack::backtrace() prior
	to this change would always evaluate to false when a node of the
	file_iterator class was encountered.)
	(input_stack::backtrace): Replace member function body with that
	of input_stack::backtrace_all().
	(input_stack::backtrace_all): Delete.
	(backtrace_request): Update the only call site of the above.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/regression_savannah_58153.sh: Add test.
	* src/roff/groff/groff.am (groff_TESTS): Run test.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/string_case_xform_errors.sh: Update
	regression test to not be confounded by additional line of
	backtrace output.  Remove bashism along the way.

	* doc/groff.texi:
	* man/groff.7.man:
	* man/groff_diff.7.man: Update documentation.

2020-04-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Reorganize backtrace output.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (string_iterator::backtrace):
	Prefix the output with the program name if it is known.  In a
	deviation from the GNU Coding Standards, put the string
	"backtrace:" immediately next instead of the file and line
	number; this is because, particularly in cases where the
	backtrace is most interesting or needed, it will produce
	multiple lines of output and the common prefix aids visual
	understanding.
	(file_iterator::backtrace): As above; also, change prefix for
	popened nodes in the iterator from "process" to "pipe".  This
	seemed preferable to omitting the information entirely or using
	an inscrutable sigil like 'f' or 'p'.  The advantage is that the
	output is better aligned--better ergonomics for those who have
	to cope with a lot of it.  Furthermore, output the filename only
	once.

	Example of old and new output:

	/tmp/inner:2: backtrace: file '/tmp/inner'
	echo .so /tmp/inner:1: backtrace: process 'echo .so /tmp/inner'
	/tmp/outer:1: backtrace: file '/tmp/outer'

	troff: backtrace: file '/tmp/inner':2
	troff: backtrace: pipe 'echo .so /tmp/inner':1
	troff: backtrace: file '/tmp/outer':1

2020-04-10  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Add units to diagnostic.
	This function works only with device-specific basic units
	internally; users likely think in terms of point size, so add
	the basic unit suffix "u" to offer a hint about what's going on.

	Example:
	$ groff -ww >/dev/null
	\s[10]A\s[-12]B
	troff: <standard input>:1: warning: point-size escape results in
	non-positive size -2000u; set to 1u

	On a PostScript device with 1000 basic units to the point, the
	difference is important and would be confusing without the unit
	indication.

2020-04-08  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Correct and clarify point size documentation.

	Our Texinfo manual has long documented the request '.ps 0' as
	restoring the previous point size (just as '\s0' or '.ps' with
	no argument does), but this is incorrect; since groff 1.02 or
	earlier (June 1991), the request has not actually worked this
	way.  Instead, '.ps 0' sets the point size to 1 basic unit
	{though output drivers may clamp this to a higher value}.  This
	behavior is consistent with AT&T troff, Hierloom Doctools troff
	and, per Ingo Schwarze, Plan 9 troff.  (It is, however, not
	consistent with neatroff.)

	* doc/groff.texi (Changing Type Sizes): Stop claiming that '.ps
	0' works like '\s0'.  Note that the resulting (computed) point
	size, not the argument, is clamped.  Note that it is
	non-positive, not negative, point sizes that are clamped to 1u.
	Add (forward) cross-reference to section where \n[.ps] is
	defined since it is mentioned here.  Move explanation of special
	handling of zero argument to \s escape description.

	* man/groff.7.man (Request short reference): Explain .ps N
	independently of \s.  Note clamping behavior.

2020-04-06  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Correctly brace 'else'
	block.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/\
	use_point_size_escape_with_single_digit_arg.sh:
	Check that we get a diagnostic when relying on ambiguous form.

2020-04-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Move special-case
	interpretation of the '\sN' form of point-size escapes when 'N'
	is 1, 2, or 3 to compatibility mode (groff -C) only, and throw
	error diagnostic with suggestion for remedy if encountered.

	Traditionally, '\s36A' is interpreted as "set point size to 36,
	then emit 'A'".  However, only values in the range 10-39 are
	handled specially; '\s40A' is interpreted as a four-point "0A".
	This is unlike anything else in *roff grammar; see \*, \$, \f,
	\F, \g, \k, \m, \M, \n, \V, \Y, and \z.

	To anticipate objections: Why not throw only a warning?  Because
	there isn't a warning category for supported but ambiguous
	syntax (this behavior of AT&T troff dates back to the mid-1970s
	but was not documented in the Troff User's Manual until 1992).
	Why not throw the error outside of compatibility mode too?
	Because outside of compatibility mode we (now) have an
	unambiguous parse.

	Background: The Graphic Systems C/A/T phototypesetter (the
	original device target for AT&T troff) only supported a few
	discrete point sizes in the range 6..36, so Ossanna
	special-cased the parser to do what the user must have meant.
	Kernighan warned of this in the 1992 revision of CSTR #54
	{§2.3}, and more recently, McIlroy referred to it as a "living
	fossil".

2020-04-04  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	Improve point-size escape diagnostics.

	* src/roff/troff/input.cpp (read_size): Disclose context
	{point-size escape intepretation} in diagnostic messages.  When
	a "bad digit" is encountered, describe it if possible.  When a
	relative adjustment results in a negative point size, report the
	computed value.  Also rename a variable for slightly more
	clarity ("bad" does not refer to all bad parses, just some cases
	of bad digits), and update an insufficiently generalized comment
	{"\s(00" is also an acceptable expression for point-size zero}.

	Based on suggestions by Ingo Schwarze and Bjarni Ingi Gislason.

	Stop ms macro package from manipulating warnings.

	* tmac/s.tmac: Remove code block that attempted to enable all
	warnings "only if none are given on the command line".  It did
	this by simply comparing the value of the warn register
	{\n[.warn]} against the default value; but of course, a user
	could specify -w options that exactly matched the default and
	the test would not be able to tell, causing puzzling and
	undesired behavior.  Furthermore, the hard-coded default was out
	of date and did not correspond to recent releases of groff.  If
	you want all warnings on, use the ".warn" request with no
	arguments in your ms document or pass "-w w" to groff (see
	troff(1) or our Texinfo manual for more on warnings).

	Thanks to Bjarni Ingi Gislason for bringing this issue to our
	attention.

	Accept any number of arguments for .Dd in the groff_mdoc(7)
	macros.

	* tmac/doc-common-u: The .Dd macro behaved in a weird way:
	Without arguments, it printed the string "Epoch".
	With one, two, four, or more arguments, it ignored all arguments
	and used the current date instead.
	Only for exactly three arguments, it printed the arguments.
	None of this made sense.  Giving the date as "Epoch" is
	absurd, and printing the current date is just misleading:
	why should a document be considered up-to-date when the author
	did not even bother to state the date of the last change?
	Admittedly, the behaviour for 0 and 4 or more arguments
	already appeared 4.3BSD-Reno, and the behaviour for 2 or 3
	arguments in 4.4BSD.  But it was already wrong even in those
	days: several manual pages in 4.4BSD gave .Dd a single, quoted
	argument, e.g. .Dd "June 9, 1993": cap_mkdb(1), id(1), sed(1),
	err(3), getcap(3), sysctl(3), amd(8), disklabel(8), and others.
	Consequently, simply print all the arguments, no matter how
	many there are.

	This bug was found by Jonathan Gray <jsg@openbsd.org>
	while he looked at 4.xBSD manual pages.

	Repair .AT and .UC in the groff_man(7) macros.

	* tmac/an-old.tmac: Setting user-defined strings in a macro that
	will later be called indirectly from page location traps is
	excessively complicated.  Besides, the implementation doesn't
	work: when the trap is finally sprung, the defaults from the
	an-init macro clobber what the author specified with .AT or .UC.
	Instead, all that is needed is setting the strings for the
	header before triggering the page break, such that they appear
	right away, while setting the strings for the footer after the
	page break, such that they don't appear on the previous page.

	The an (man) macro package supports new CS and CT number
	registers to control rendering of man page section headings and
	titles, respectively, in full capitals.  These default off (with
	no visible effect on pages which already fully capitalize these
	strings in man page sources).  The rationale is to encourage man
	page authors to preserve case distinction information in (or
	restore it to) their titles and section headings, while giving
	users (including system administrators, distributors,
	integrators, and maintainers of man(1) implementations) a way to
	view the rendered page elements in full capitals if desired.

	devlatin1: Map \(oq to ' on output.

	* font/devlatin1/R.proto: Render the output glyph \[oq]
	{opening quote} as 0x27 (apostrophe) instead of 0x60 (grave
	accent).  A grave accent is just flat wrong for the Latin-1
	character set, a.k.a. ISO 8859-1.  The defining document ECMA-94
	{June 1986} is freely available for perusal.  The ECMA-94 Latin
	character sets do not define any glyphs for directional
	{"typographer's"} quotation marks, but the apostrophe is
	depicted as a neutral (vertical) glyph, whereas the grave accent
	0x60 and acute accent 0xB4 are mirror-symmetric diacritical
	marks.

	Note that this change has no effect on _input_ conventions for
	roff source documents.  You can still get directional single
	quotes on UTF-8, PostScript, PDF, and other output devices
	supporting them by typing sequences like `this' in the input
	{character remapping with ".char" requests and similar
	notwithstanding}.

	Patch and idea from Ingo Schwarze, who originally proposed it
	for ASCII as well, and included Latin-1 for parallelism.
	The groff developers could reach no consensus about the wisdom
	of such a change for ASCII (which was designed to support
	ambiguity for some code points, requiring the development of
	supplementary interpretation conventions between parties).
	ECMA-94/ISO-8859 is more strongly prescriptive.

	See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?55616 and the groff mailing
	list archives for 31 January to 23 February 2019 at
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/groff for lengthy discussion.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/on-latin1-device-oq-is-0x27.sh: Check for
	correct output glyph.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.am: Add test.

2019-06-28  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	* tmac/unicode.tmac: Save and restore compatibility mode since
	the script uses a GNU extension (.char).

2019-06-27  G. Branden Robinson <g.branden.robinson@gmail.com>

	libdriver: Fix SEGV (Savannah #56555).

	* src/libs/libdriver/printer.cpp: Check result of
	set_char_and_width() for error condition before relying on it.

	* src/roff/groff/tests/regression-56555.sh: Provoke segfault
	with five bytes of input using transparent line indicator.

	* src/roff/groff/groff.am: Add test.

	Correctly handle groff_mdoc(7) .Lk arguments starting with a
	dot.

	* tmac/doc.tmac-u: Each argument to the .Lk macro is printed
	on its own roff input line.  If it happens to start with a dot
	or apostroph, it was misinterpreted as a request or macro.
	Force it to be treated as text by adding "\&" in front of it.

2018-12-31  Ingo Schwarze  <schwarze@openbsd.org>

	* man/groff_diff.7.man: remove two stray .RE macros
