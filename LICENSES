LICENSES
--------

groff is a free software project.  It is licensed under the GNU General
Public License (GPL), version 3 or later.

The file COPYING in the top directory of the groff source distribution
contains a copy of the GPL that was downloaded from the GNU web site
<http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt> on 3 January 2009.

All files in the groff source distribution are distributed under the
terms of this version of the GPL.  You are free to choose version 3 or
any subsequent version of the GPL.  Some are distributed under
alternative terms as well.

The text of the GPL contains a postal address from which you can obtain
the current version of the license.  Further information is available on
the Web at <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft>.

groff is an effort of the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation
(FSF); with the exceptions noted below, the copyrights of all files
comprising it have been assigned to the FSF.  Information on GNU and the
FSF may be found at <http://www.fsf.org/>.

The GNU troff manual, doc/groff.texi, written in Texinfo, is
dual-licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (FDL) _and_ the
GNU GPL.  This status is to honor the intentions of its authors and to
permit frictionless migration of material between that manual and
groff's man pages, which are under the GPL as noted above.

Files in the contrib/ subdirectory of the source distribution are not
strictly part of groff.  That is, they are distributed with it and are
Free Software <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>, but they
are not considered essential parts of the distribution.  Further, they
may bear licenses other than the GPL or the FSF does not administer
their copyrights.  To determine their copyright status and licensing,
see the "COPYRIGHT" file in the appropriate subdirectory of contrib/.

Some files are part of groff but bear licenses in addition to the GPL,
or have been placed into the public domain, because they originated
elsewhere; often, the groff project has modified them, sometimes
extensively.  These multi-licensed groff components are as follows.
Their file names are not always identical to those in their original
distributions, but we have kept them similar.

grn preprocessor
================

grn, written by Barry Roitblat <barry@rentonww.com> and David
Slattengren <slatteng@Xinet.COM>, was part of the Berkeley
device-independent troff distribution.  The files contain no AT&T code
and are in the public domain.  Historically, the original package could
be found at <http://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/misc/grn.tar.Z>.
