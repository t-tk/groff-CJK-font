Here are some things that would be useful additions to groff:

  ideal preprocessor - Bernd Warken <groff-bernd.warken-72@web.de> I
	started the programming of `ideal' language and `gideal'
	preprocessor, which will eventually be added to the groff
	distribution.

  refer: `refer' database directory under /usr/local/share.
  	 There maybe create a default database `Ind' or others for
  	 storing books and documents for `groff' man pages.
	 Write the following `groff' programs from Heirloom and
  	 `refer' history:
	 - addbib
	 - roffbib
	 - sortbib

  -mv macros (for typesetting viewgraphs and slides)

  a deroff that understands long names

  a page-makeup postprocessor and associated macro package
  (like pm and -mpm)

If you want to work on one of these, you should probably post to
gnu.groff.bug (or send email to groff@gnu.org) to see if anyone else
has gotten there first.
