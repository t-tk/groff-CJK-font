More stuff for groff
====================

Windows 32
----------

Here are two ports using the gcc compiler and other GNU tools:

. Cygwin:

    http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

  Look for a convenient mirror site in

    http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html

  At any of those mirrors, groff can be found in the directory
  latest/groff.

. Kees Zeelenberg <c.zeelenberg@hccnet.nl>:

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/groffl.htm

  This port includes recent versions of grap and deroff.


dos
---

Binaries for Eli Zaretskii's port using the djgpp compiler are available
from

  ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/gro*b.zip

and its mirrors; for installation details please read `arch/djgpp/README'.
This port also runs on Windows 32 systems, except Windows 2000.


grap
----

An implementation of Kernighan & Bentley's grap language for typesetting
graphs.  Written by Ted Faber <faber@lunabase.org>.  The actual version
can be found at

  http://www.lunabase.org/~faber/Vault/software/grap/

A djgpp port which runs on dos and most Windows 32 systems (Windows 95,
Windows 98, Windows NT) done by Kees Zeelenberg <c.zeelenberg@hccnet.nl>
is available from

  ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2apps/

It is intended to be used with the djgpp port of groff.

A Windows 32 port is included in the groff package available from

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/


plot2dev
--------

This utility program can convert plot graphics to either pic or gremlin
files.  It has been written by Richard Murphey <richard-murphey@rice.edu>
and Daniel Senderowicz <daniel@synchrods.com> (who has added the gremlin
driver).  The actual version can be found as

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/plot2dev-x.x.tar.gz


troffcvt
--------

From the web page:

  troffcvt is a translator that turns troff input into a form that can be
  more easily processed.  The troffcvt distribution comes with
  postprocessors that turn troffcvt into various destination formats such
  as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), RTF (Rich Text Format) or plain
  text.

Note that you need a lot of additional packages to compile troffcvt;
everything is available from

  http://www.primate.wisc.edu/software/troffcvt/


unroff
------

From the README file:

  Unroff is a Scheme-based, programmable, extensible troff translator with
  a back-end for the Hypertext Markup Language.  Unroff is free software
  and is distributed both as source and as precompiled binaries.

    http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~net/unroff/unroff.html

You need als Elk, the Scheme based Extension Language Kit, which is
available from

  http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~net/elk


deroff
------

Deroff removes roff constructs from documents for the purpose of indexing,
spell checking etc.

Michael Haardt's <michael@moria.de> implementation is a little smarter
than traditional implementations, because it knows about certain -man and
-mm macros.  It is able to generate a word list for spell checking tools
or omit headers for sentence analysis tools.  It can further generate
cpp-style #line lines.

  http://www.moria.de/~michael/deroff/

Version 1.6 compiled with DJGPP (for MS-DOS and all Windows 32 systems,
i.e. Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT) is available from

  ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2apps/

and its mirrors.

A Windows 32 port of version 1.8 is available from

  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/

David Frey <dfrey@debian.org> has also written a deroff implementation
for Debian; it is available from

  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/deroff/


texi2html
---------

This package contains beta support for a backend to convert files from
texinfo format to a troff input file (using the -me macros):

  texi2html --init roff.init ...

URL:

  http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/texi2html/


doclifter
---------

doclifter lifts troff macro markup to XML-Docbook.  It doesn't do raw troff
at all well (raw troff has insufficient structural information) but it 
handles manual pages, ms, mm, and me markup, producing clean lifts
to valid XML more than 96% of the time.  pic markup is translated to SVG,
eqn markup to Presentation MathML.

doclifter with the -w option behaves as a portability checker and validator,
warning about constructs that aren't portable across *roff implementations
and viewers.

It is available from

  http://catb.org/~esr/doclifter


pic2plot
--------

pic2plot, part of the GNU plotutils package, can lift pic markup to SVG.
The plotutils package is available at

  http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/


miscellaneous
-------------

. Ralph Corderoy's excellent page on troff:

    www.troff.org

  There are links for virtually everything related to troff.

. Dr. Robert Hermann's groff gems are available from

    http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/RBHerrmann/GROFF/index.html

  At present there are examples for

  o creating business cards
  o using groff to make large format posters for presentations

. Robert Marks's collection of useful macros and scripts is available from

    http://www.agsm.edu.au/~bobm/odds+ends/scripts.html

  Description:

  o `polish': Is a sed (= the Unix stream editor) script that does many
    things to ASCII text.  Amongst other things, it breaks lines at new
    sentences, reduces upper-case acronyms by one point size, adds
    diacriticals, changes simple quotes into smart quotes, and makes a few
    simple grammar checks.  The best way to see what it does is to run it
    as a sed script file (or files) on a text file and then compare the
    output file with the original.

  o `DropCaps' is a troff script which replaces the initial letters of
    paragraphs immediately after H1 and H2 headings with drop-capitals of
    specified point size, and automatically flows the text around the new
    drop cap.

  o `AJM Header' is a set of troff macros used in production of the
    Australian Journal of Management.  They use the Memorandum Macros (mm)
    of AT&T, and so should be invoked with the Unix troff -mm flag; they
    should also work with the GNU troff -mm flag.

. Various contributed stuff like additional font files, macro packages, and
  documentation can be found at

    http://groff.ffii.org/groff/contrib/

. Thomas Baruchel <baruchel@libertysurf.fr> has developed Meta-tbl, a tbl
  postprocessor to manipulate table cells (like adding gray shades).  The
  latest version can be found at

    http://perso.libertysurf.fr/baruchel/

. gpresent, written by Bob Diertens <bobd@science.uva.nl>.  From the README
  file:

    gpresent is a package for making presentation with groff and acroread.
    It consist of a set of macros to be used with groff and a post-processor
    for manipulating the PostScript output of groff.  Without the use of the
    PAUSE macro, it can also be used for making slides.
    
  It is available from

    www.science.uva.nl/~bobd/useful/gpresent/
