What is groff?
==============

groff (GNU roff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text input
files that include formatting commands to produce output in PostScript,
PDF, HTML, or DVI formats or for display to a terminal.  Formatting
commands can be low-level typesetting primitives, macros from a
supplied package, or user-defined macros.  All three approaches can be
combined.

A reimplementation and extension of the typesetter from AT&T Unix, groff
is present on most POSIX systems owing to its long association with Unix
manuals (including man pages).  It and its predecessor are notable for
their production of several best-selling software engineering texts.
groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents
while consuming minimal system resources.

Changes
=======

Since groff 1.23.0 was released on 5 July 2023, MM people have made a
total of over NNN commits.

[[ Changes since the most recent release candidate, 1.yy.0.rcZ ... ]]

[[ maintainer: Insert output of
   "git shortlog --summary 1.22.4..1.23.0" ]]

[[ Headline features nominated by our development community include: ]]

For more on these and other feature changes, see "News" below.

[[ As of this writing, per the GNU Savannah bug tracker, the groff
project has resolved NNN problems as fixed for the 1.yy.0 release. ]]

Classifying these issues by type and the component of the project to
which they apply, we find the following.

Another way of capturing the amount of revision is as follows.

$ git diff --stat 1.23.0 1.yy.0 | tail -n 1

Obtaining groff
===============

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*].
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz URL ]]
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz.sig URL ]]

[[ maintainer: include the following for final release:
Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth.
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz.sig
]]

Here are the SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz

The SHA-256 checksum is encoded in Base64 instead of the hexadecimal
form that most checksum tools default to.  The mechanism follows.

sha256sum < groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz | cut -f1 -d\  | xxd -r -p | base64

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
    .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig
    file and the corresponding archive.  Then, verify the archive.

      gpg --verify groff-1.yy.0.tar.gz{.sig,}

    If that command fails because you don't have the required public
    key, you can import it.

      wget -O 96214.asc \
        'https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=96214'
      gpg --import 96214.asc

    Re-run the 'gpg --verify' command subsequently.

Caveats
=======

o Some portability issues are known to affect groff's gdiffmk utility.

  gdiffmk does not work with BusyBox diff (which does not implement GNU
  diff's "-D" option).

  gdiffmk does not work on FreeBSD due to specifics of that platform's
  expr(1) implementation.

o GNU tools, or otherwise POSIX-conforming ones, are generally required
  to build on Solaris 10 or 11.  See the "PROBLEMS" file in the
  distribution archive.

o Solaris 10 has known problems with automated tests; see the "PROBLEMS"
  file in the distribution archive.
