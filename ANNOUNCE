What is groff?
==============

Groff (GNU roff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text input
files that include formatting commands to produce formatted output in
PostScript, PDF, HTML, DVI formats or for display to the terminal.
Formatting commands can be low-level typesetting primitives or macros
from a supplied set.  Users may also write their own macros.  All three
may be combined.

Present on most Unix systems owing to its long association with Unix
manuals (including man pages), and notable for its use in the production
of several best-selling software engineering texts, groff is capable of
producing typographically sophisticated documents while consuming
minimal system resources.

Changes
=======

groff 1.23.0.rc2 represents nearly 2 years of development since the
previous release candidate, and nearly four since the last release.

Headline features nominated by our development community include:
  * a new 'man' macro, "MR", for formatting man page cross references;
  * hyperlinked text in terminals via the ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape sequence;
  * a new "rfc1345" macro package, contributed by Dorai Sitaram,
    enabling use of RFC 1345 mnemonics as groff special characters;
  * a new "sboxes" macro package, contributed by Deri James, enabling
    'ms' documents to place shaded and/or bordered rectangles underneath
    any groff page elements (PDF output only);
  * version 2.5 of Peter Schaffter's "mom" macro package;
  * the 'ms' package's new strings to assist subscripting; and
  * new hyphenation patterns for English.

For more on these and other feature changes, see "News" below.

Much attention has been given to fixing bugs and improving
documentation.

As of this writing, per the GNU Savannah bug tracker, the groff project
has resolved 351 problems as fixed for the 1.23.0 release.  Some of the
bugs we've corrected were over 30 years old.

Another way of capturing the amount of revision is as follows.

Obtaining groff
===============

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*].

  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.23.0.tar.gz.sig
]]

Here are the SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz

The SHA-256 checksum is encoded in Base64 instead of the hexadecimal
form that most checksum tools default to.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
    .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig
    file and the corresponding archive.  Then, verify the archive.

      gpg --verify groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz

    If that command fails because you don't have the required public
    key, you can import it.

      gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys [[ maintainer: keyID ]]

    Re-run the 'gpg --verify' command subsequently.
