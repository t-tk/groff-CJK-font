What is groff?
==============

groff (GNU roff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text input
files that include formatting commands to produce output in PostScript,
PDF, HTML, or DVI formats or for display to a terminal.  Formatting
commands can be low-level typesetting primitives, macros from a
supplied package, or user-defined macros.  All three approaches can be
combined.

A reimplementation and extension of the typesetter from AT&T Unix, groff
is present on most POSIX systems owing to its long association with Unix
manuals (including man pages).  It and its predecessor are notable for
their production of several best-selling software engineering texts.
groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents
while consuming minimal system resources.

Changes
=======

Changes since the most recent release candidate, 1.23.0.rc4, comprise
about 200 commits' worth of changes to documentation, including over
1,000 lines of updates to each of doc/groff.texi (our Texinfo manual)
and the man pages groff_mm(7) and eqn(1).

Since groff 1.22.4 was released in December 2018, 28 people have made a
total of over 4,500 commits.

[[ maintainer: Insert output of
   "git shortlog --summary 1.22.4..1.23.0" ]]

(Some possibly surprising names in the above are due to a rebase of
groff me(7) against 4.4BSD.)

Headline features nominated by our development community include:
  * a new 'man' macro, "MR", for formatting man page cross references;
  * hyperlinked text in terminals via the ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape sequence;
  * a new 'rfc1345' macro package, contributed by Dorai Sitaram,
    enabling use of RFC 1345 mnemonics as groff special characters;
  * a new 'sboxes' macro package, contributed by Deri James, enabling
    'ms' documents to place shaded and/or bordered rectangles underneath
    any groff page elements (PDF output only);
  * 'mom' 2.5, a macro package contributed by Peter Schaffter;
  * the 'ms' package's new strings to assist subscripting;
  * Italian localization, including hyphenation patterns and macro
    package string translations, thanks to Edmond Orignac; and
  * new hyphenation patterns for English.

For more on these and other feature changes, see "News" below.

Much attention has been given to fixing bugs, improving diagnostic
messages, and correcting and expanding documentation.  The previous
release shipped with three automated unit tests; this one ships with
over 160 unit and regression tests.

As of this writing, per the GNU Savannah bug tracker, the groff project
has resolved 431 problems as fixed for the 1.23.0 release.  Some of the
bugs we've corrected were over 30 years old.

Classifying these issues by type and the component of the project to
which they apply, we find the following.

Obtaining groff
===============

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*].
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz URL ]]
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz.sig URL ]]

[[ maintainer: include the following for final release:
Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth.
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.23.0.tar.gz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.23.0.tar.gz.sig
]]

Here are the SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  groff-1.23.0.tar.gz
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  groff-1.23.0.tar.gz

The SHA-256 checksum is encoded in Base64 instead of the hexadecimal
form that most checksum tools default to.  The mechanism follows.

sha256sum < groff-1.23.0.tar.gz | cut -f1 -d\  | xxd -r -p | base64

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
    .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig
    file and the corresponding archive.  Then, verify the archive.

      gpg --verify groff-1.23.0.tar.gz{.sig,}

    If that command fails because you don't have the required public
    key, you can import it.

      wget -O 96214.asc \
        'https://savannah.gnu.org/people/viewgpg.php?user_id=96214'
      gpg --import 96214.asc

    Re-run the 'gpg --verify' command subsequently.

Caveats
=======

o Some portability issues are known to affect groff's gdiffmk utility.

  A defect in GNU diffutils 3.9 (January 2023) causes gdiffmk to
  malfunction and its automated test to fail.  See
  <https://debbugs.gnu.org/db/61/61193.html>.

  gdiffmk does not work with BusyBox diff (which does not implement GNU
  diff's "-D" option).

  gdiffmk does not work on FreeBSD due to specifics of that platform's
  expr(1) implementation.

o GNU tools, or otherwise POSIX-conforming ones, are generally required
  to build on Solaris 10 or 11.  See the "PROBLEMS" file in the
  distribution archive.

o Solaris 10 has known problems with automated tests; see the "PROBLEMS"
  file in the distribution archive.

o There is a problem building on "newlib"-using systems when X11 support
  is enabled; see the "PROBLEMS" file in the distribution archive.

o The build is known to not work with the MSVC compiler.  There are no
  plans to address this before C23 standardized attributes become
  available.
