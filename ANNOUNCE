What is groff?
==============

groff (GNU roff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text input
files that include formatting commands to produce output in PostScript,
PDF, HTML, or DVI formats or for display to a terminal.  Formatting
commands can be low-level typesetting primitives, macros from a
supplied package, or user-defined macros.  All three approaches can be
combined.

A reimplementation and extension of the typesetter from AT&T Unix, groff
is present on most POSIX systems owing to its long association with Unix
manuals (including man pages).  It and its predecessor are notable for
their production of several best-selling software engineering texts.
groff is capable of producing typographically sophisticated documents
while consuming minimal system resources.

Changes
=======

groff 1.23.0.rc2 represents two years of development since the previous
release candidate, and nearly four since the last release.

Headline features nominated by our development community include:
  * a new 'man' macro, "MR", for formatting man page cross references;
  * hyperlinked text in terminals via the ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape sequence;
  * a new 'rfc1345' macro package, contributed by Dorai Sitaram,
    enabling use of RFC 1345 mnemonics as groff special characters;
  * a new 'sboxes' macro package, contributed by Deri James, enabling
    'ms' documents to place shaded and/or bordered rectangles underneath
    any groff page elements (PDF output only);
  * 'mom' 2.5, a macro package contributed by Peter Schaffter;
  * the 'ms' package's new strings to assist subscripting;
  * Italian localization, including hyphenation patterns and macro
    package string translations, thanks to Edmond Orignac; and
  * new hyphenation patterns for English.

For more on these and other feature changes, see "News" below.

Much attention has been given to fixing bugs, improving diagnostic
messages, and correcting and expanding documentation.  The previous
release shipped with three automated unit tests; this one ships with
over 130 unit and regression tests.

As of this writing, per the GNU Savannah bug tracker, the groff project
has resolved 379 problems as fixed for the 1.23.0 release.  Some of the
bugs we've corrected were over 30 years old.

Classifying these issues by type and the component of the project to
which they apply, we find the following.

Obtaining groff
===============

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature[*].
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz URL ]]
  [[ maintainer: insert .tar.gz.sig URL ]]

[[ maintainer: include the following for final release:
Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth.
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.23.0.tar.gz
  https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/groff/groff-1.23.0.tar.gz.sig
]]

Here are the SHA-1 and SHA-256 checksums.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz

The SHA-256 checksum is encoded in Base64 instead of the hexadecimal
form that most checksum tools default to.

[*] Use a .sig file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
    .sig suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the .sig
    file and the corresponding archive.  Then, verify the archive.

      gpg --verify groff-1.23.0.rc2.tar.gz

    If that command fails because you don't have the required public
    key, you can import it.

      gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys [[ maintainer: keyID ]]

    Re-run the 'gpg --verify' command subsequently.
