# Note 1: It would be nice to apply the DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself")
# principle here and store the entire command string to be executed into

#
#   cmd="PATH=... groff ... $@"
#   ...
#   printf "%s\n" "$cmd"
#   ...
#   eval $cmd
#
# Unfortunately, the shell is a nightmarish hellscape of quoting issues.
# Na√Øve attempts to solve the problem fail when arguments to nroff
# contain embedded whitespace or shell metacharacters.  The solution
# below works with those, but there is insufficient quoting in -V (dry
# run) mode, such that you can't cut-and-paste the output of 'nroff -V'
# if you pass it a filename like foo"bar (with the embedded quotation
# mark) and expect it to run without further quoting.
#
# If POSIX adopts Bash's ${var@Q} or an equivalent, this issue can be
# revisited.
#
# Note 2: The construction '${1+"@$"}' is not for compatibility with old
# or buggy shells, but to preserve the absence of arguments.  We don't
# want 'nroff' to become 'groff ... ""' if $# equals zero.
